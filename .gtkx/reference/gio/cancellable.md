# GCancellable

`GCancellable` allows operations to be cancelled.

`GCancellable` is a thread-safe operation cancellation stack used
throughout GIO to allow for cancellation of synchronous and
asynchronous operations.

```tsx
import { GCancellable } from "@gtkx/jsx/gio";
```

## Hierarchy

[GObject](.gtkx/reference/gobject/object.md) → **GCancellable**

## Props

`ref` receives the `Gio.Cancellable` instance. Every mutable property also has an `onNotify<Prop>` handler prop called with the new value when the property changes. Props inherited from ancestor elements are documented on their own pages.

## Signals

### `onCancelled`

```ts
(self: Gio.Cancellable) => void
```

Emitted when the operation has been cancelled.

Can be used by implementations of cancellable operations. If the
operation is cancelled from another thread, the signal will be
emitted in the thread that cancelled the operation, not the
thread that is running the operation.

Note that disconnecting from this signal (or any signal) in a
multi-threaded program is prone to race conditions. For instance
it is possible that a signal handler may be invoked even after
a call to `g_signal_handler_disconnect()` for that handler has
already returned.

There is also a problem when cancellation happens right before
connecting to the signal. If this happens the signal will
unexpectedly not be emitted, and checking before connecting to
the signal leaves a race condition where this is still happening.

In order to make it safe and easy to connect handlers there
are two helper functions: `g_cancellable_connect()` and
`g_cancellable_disconnect()` which protect against problems
like this.

An example of how to us this:
```c
// Make sure we don't do unnecessary work if already cancelled
    if (g_cancellable_set_error_if_cancelled (cancellable, error))
      return;

    // Set up all the data needed to be able to handle cancellation
    // of the operation
    my_data = my_data_new (...);

    id = 0;
    if (cancellable)
      id = g_cancellable_connect (cancellable,
    			      G_CALLBACK (cancelled_handler)
    			      data, NULL);

    // cancellable operation here...

    g_cancellable_disconnect (cancellable, id);

    // cancelled_handler is never called after this, it is now safe
    // to free the data
    my_data_free (my_data);
```

Note that the cancelled signal is emitted in the thread that
the user cancelled from, which may be the main thread. So, the
cancellable signal should not do something that can block.

**Parameters**

- `self`: The instance the signal was emitted on.

## Methods

Methods are called on the `Gio.Cancellable` instance, obtained with the `ref` prop or imported from `@gtkx/gi/gio`. Methods inherited from ancestors are documented on their own pages.

### `cancel`

```ts
cancel(): void
```

Will set `cancellable` to cancelled, and will emit the
`GCancellable.cancelled` signal. (However, see the warning about
race conditions in the documentation for that signal if you are
planning to connect to it.)

This function is thread-safe. In other words, you can safely call
it from a thread other than the one running the operation that was
passed the `cancellable`.

If `cancellable` is `null`, this function returns immediately for convenience.

The convention within GIO is that cancelling an asynchronous
operation causes it to complete asynchronously. That is, if you
cancel the operation from the same thread in which it is running,
then the operation's `GAsyncReadyCallback` will not be invoked until
the application returns to the main loop.

It is safe (although useless, since it will be a no-op) to call
this function from a `Gio.Cancellable.cancelled` signal handler.

### `disconnect`

```ts
disconnect(handlerId: bigint): void
```

Disconnects a handler from a cancellable instance similar to
`g_signal_handler_disconnect()`.  Additionally, in the event that a
signal handler is currently running, this call will block until the
handler has finished.  Calling this function from a
`GCancellable.cancelled` signal handler will therefore result in a
deadlock.

This avoids a race condition where a thread cancels at the
same time as the cancellable operation is finished and the
signal handler is removed. See `GCancellable.cancelled` for
details on how to use this.

If `cancellable` is `null` or `handler_id` is `0` this function does
nothing.

**Parameters**

- `handlerId`: Handler id of the handler to be disconnected, or `0`.

_Available since 2.22._

### `getFd`

```ts
getFd(): number
```

Gets the file descriptor for a cancellable job. This can be used to
implement cancellable operations on Unix systems. The returned fd will
turn readable when `cancellable` is cancelled.

You are not supposed to read from the fd yourself, just check for
readable status. Reading to unset the readable status is done
with `g_cancellable_reset()`.

After a successful return from this function, you should use
`g_cancellable_release_fd()` to free up resources allocated for
the returned file descriptor.

See also `g_cancellable_make_pollfd()`.

**Returns** A valid file descriptor. `-1` if the file descriptor
is not supported, or on errors.

### `isCancelled`

```ts
isCancelled(): boolean
```

Checks if a cancellable job has been cancelled.

**Returns** `true` if `cancellable` is cancelled,
FALSE if called with `null` or if item is not cancelled.

### `makePollfd`

```ts
makePollfd(pollfd: GLib.PollFD): boolean
```

Creates a `GPollFD` corresponding to `cancellable`; this can be passed
to `g_poll()` and used to poll for cancellation. This is useful both
for unix systems without a native poll and for portability to
windows.

When this function returns `true`, you should use
`g_cancellable_release_fd()` to free up resources allocated for the
`pollfd`. After a `false` return, do not call `g_cancellable_release_fd()`.

If this function returns `false`, either no `cancellable` was given or
resource limits prevent this function from allocating the necessary
structures for polling. (On Linux, you will likely have reached
the maximum number of file descriptors.) The suggested way to handle
these cases is to ignore the `cancellable`.

You are not supposed to read from the fd yourself, just check for
readable status. Reading to unset the readable status is done
with `g_cancellable_reset()`.

Note that in the event that a `Gio.Cancellable.cancelled` signal handler is
currently running, this call will block until the handler has finished.
Calling this function from a signal handler will therefore result in a
deadlock.

**Parameters**

- `pollfd`: a pointer to a `GPollFD`

**Returns** `true` if `pollfd` was successfully initialized, `false` on
         failure to prepare the cancellable.

_Available since 2.22._

### `popCurrent`

```ts
popCurrent(): void
```

Pops `cancellable` off the cancellable stack (verifying that `cancellable`
is on the top of the stack).

### `pushCurrent`

```ts
pushCurrent(): void
```

Pushes `cancellable` onto the cancellable stack. The current
cancellable can then be received using `g_cancellable_get_current()`.

This is useful when implementing cancellable operations in
code that does not allow you to pass down the cancellable object.

This is typically called automatically by e.g. `GFile` operations,
so you rarely have to call this yourself.

### `releaseFd`

```ts
releaseFd(): void
```

Releases a resources previously allocated by `g_cancellable_get_fd()`
or `g_cancellable_make_pollfd()`.

For compatibility reasons with older releases, calling this function
is not strictly required, the resources will be automatically freed
when the `cancellable` is finalized. However, the `cancellable` will
block scarce file descriptors until it is finalized if this function
is not called. This can cause the application to run out of file
descriptors when many `GCancellables` are used at the same time.

Note that in the event that a `Gio.Cancellable.cancelled` signal handler is
currently running, this call will block until the handler has finished.
Calling this function from a signal handler will therefore result in a
deadlock.

_Available since 2.22._

### `reset`

```ts
reset(): void
```

Resets `cancellable` to its uncancelled state.

If cancellable is currently in use by any cancellable operation
then the behavior of this function is undefined.

Note that it is generally not a good idea to reuse an existing
cancellable for more operations after it has been cancelled once,
as this function might tempt you to do. The recommended practice
is to drop the reference to a cancellable after cancelling it,
and let it die with the outstanding async operations. You should
create a fresh cancellable for further async operations.

In the event that a `Gio.Cancellable.cancelled` signal handler is currently
running, this call will block until the handler has finished.
Calling this function from a signal handler will therefore result in a
deadlock.

### `setErrorIfCancelled`

```ts
setErrorIfCancelled(): boolean
```

If the `cancellable` is cancelled, sets the error to notify
that the operation was cancelled.

**Returns** `true` if `cancellable` was cancelled, `false` if it was not

**Throws** A `GLib.Error` carrying the failing operation's domain, code, and message.

### `sourceNew`

```ts
sourceNew(): GLib.Source
```

Creates a source that triggers if `cancellable` is cancelled and
calls its callback of type `GCancellableSourceFunc`. This is
primarily useful for attaching to another (non-cancellable) source
with `g_source_add_child_source()` to add cancellability to it.

For convenience, you can call this with a `null` `GCancellable`,
in which case the source will never trigger.

The new `GSource` will hold a reference to the `GCancellable`.

**Returns** the new `GSource`.

_Available since 2.28._

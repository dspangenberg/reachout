# GDBusServer

`GDBusServer` is a helper for listening to and accepting D-Bus
connections. This can be used to create a new D-Bus server, allowing two
peers to use the D-Bus protocol for their own specialized communication.
A server instance provided in this way will not perform message routing or
implement the
[`org.freedesktop.DBus` interface](https://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus-specification.html#message-bus-messages).

To just export an object on a well-known name on a message bus, such as the
session or system bus, you should instead use `Gio.busOwnName()`.

An example of peer-to-peer communication with GDBus can be found
in [gdbus-example-peer.c](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/glib/-/blob/HEAD/gio/tests/gdbus-example-peer.c).

Note that a minimal `GDBusServer` will accept connections from any
peer. In many use-cases it will be necessary to add a
`Gio.DBusAuthObserver` that only accepts connections that have
successfully authenticated as the same user that is running the
`GDBusServer`. Since GLib 2.68 this can be achieved more simply by passing
the `G_DBUS_SERVER_FLAGS_AUTHENTICATION_REQUIRE_SAME_USER` flag to the
server.

_Available since 2.26._

```tsx
import { GDBusServer } from "@gtkx/jsx/gio";
```

## Hierarchy

[GObject](.gtkx/reference/gobject/object.md) → **GDBusServer**

Implements `GInitable`.

## Static methods

Static methods are called on `Gio.DBusServer`, imported from `@gtkx/gi/gio`.

### `newSync`

```ts
newSync(address: string, flags: Gio.DBusServerFlags, guid: string, observer: Gio.DBusAuthObserver | null, cancellable: Gio.Cancellable | null): Gio.DBusServer
```

Creates a new D-Bus server that listens on the first address in
`address` that works.

Once constructed, you can use `g_dbus_server_get_client_address()` to
get a D-Bus address string that clients can use to connect.

To have control over the available authentication mechanisms and
the users that are authorized to connect, it is strongly recommended
to provide a non-`null` `GDBusAuthObserver`.

Connect to the `GDBusServer.new-connection` signal to handle
incoming connections.

The returned `GDBusServer` isn't active - you have to start it with
`g_dbus_server_start()`.

`GDBusServer` is used in this [example](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/glib/-/blob/HEAD/gio/tests/gdbus-example-peer.c).

This is a synchronous failable constructor. There is currently no
asynchronous version.

**Parameters**

- `address`: A D-Bus address.
- `flags`: Flags from the `GDBusServerFlags` enumeration.
- `guid`: A D-Bus GUID.
- `observer`: A `GDBusAuthObserver` or `null`.
- `cancellable`: A `GCancellable` or `null`.

**Returns** A `GDBusServer` or `null` if `error` is set.

**Throws** A `GLib.Error` carrying the failing operation's domain, code, and message.

_Available since 2.26._

## Props

`ref` receives the `Gio.DBusServer` instance. Every mutable property also has an `onNotify<Prop>` handler prop called with the new value when the property changes. Props inherited from ancestor elements are documented on their own pages.

### `active`

`boolean` · default `false` · read-only, observe with `onNotifyActive`

Whether the server is currently active.

_Available since 2.26._

### `address`

`string` · default `null` · construct-only

The D-Bus address to listen on.

_Available since 2.26._

### `authenticationObserver`

`Gio.DBusAuthObserver` · construct-only

A `GDBusAuthObserver` object to assist in the authentication process or `null`.

_Available since 2.26._

### `clientAddress`

`string` · default `null` · read-only, observe with `onNotifyClientAddress`

The D-Bus address that clients can use.

_Available since 2.26._

### `flags`

`Gio.DBusServerFlags` · default `G_DBUS_SERVER_FLAGS_NONE` · construct-only

Flags from the `GDBusServerFlags` enumeration.

_Available since 2.26._

### `guid`

`string` · default `null` · construct-only

The GUID of the server.

See `GDBusConnection.guid` for more details.

_Available since 2.26._

## Signals

### `onNewConnection`

```ts
(connection: Gio.DBusConnection, self: Gio.DBusServer) => boolean | undefined
```

Emitted when a new authenticated connection has been made. Use
`g_dbus_connection_get_peer_credentials()` to figure out what
identity (if any), was authenticated.

If you want to accept the connection, take a reference to the
`connection` object and return `true`. When you are done with the
connection call `g_dbus_connection_close()` and give up your
reference. Note that the other peer may disconnect at any time -
a typical thing to do when accepting a connection is to listen to
the `GDBusConnection.closed` signal.

If `GDBusServer.flags` contains `G_DBUS_SERVER_FLAGS_RUN_IN_THREAD`
then the signal is emitted in a new thread dedicated to the
connection. Otherwise the signal is emitted in the thread-default
main context (see `GLib.MainContext.pushThreadDefault()`)
of the thread that `server` was constructed in.

You are guaranteed that signal handlers for this signal runs
before incoming messages on `connection` are processed. This means
that it's suitable to call `g_dbus_connection_register_object()` or
similar from the signal handler.

**Parameters**

- `connection`: A `GDBusConnection` for the new connection.
- `self`: The instance the signal was emitted on.

**Returns** `true` to claim `connection`, `false` to let other handlers
run.

_Available since 2.26._

## Methods

Methods are called on the `Gio.DBusServer` instance, obtained with the `ref` prop or imported from `@gtkx/gi/gio`. Methods inherited from ancestors are documented on their own pages.

### `getClientAddress`

```ts
getClientAddress(): string
```

Gets a
[D-Bus address](https://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus-specification.html#addresses)
string that can be used by clients to connect to `server`.

This is valid and non-empty if initializing the `GDBusServer` succeeded.

**Returns** A D-Bus address string.

_Available since 2.26._

### `getFlags`

```ts
getFlags(): Gio.DBusServerFlags
```

Gets the flags for `server`.

**Returns** A set of flags from the `GDBusServerFlags` enumeration.

_Available since 2.26._

### `getGuid`

```ts
getGuid(): string
```

Gets the GUID for `server`, as provided to `g_dbus_server_new_sync()`.

**Returns** A D-Bus GUID.

_Available since 2.26._

### `isActive`

```ts
isActive(): boolean
```

Gets whether `server` is active.

**Returns** `true` if server is active, `false` otherwise.

_Available since 2.26._

### `start`

```ts
start(): void
```

Starts `server`.

_Available since 2.26._

### `stop`

```ts
stop(): void
```

Stops `server`.

_Available since 2.26._

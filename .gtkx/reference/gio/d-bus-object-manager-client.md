# GDBusObjectManagerClient

`GDBusObjectManagerClient` is used to create, monitor and delete object
proxies for remote objects exported by a `Gio.DBusObjectManagerServer`
(or any code implementing the
[org.freedesktop.DBus.ObjectManager](http://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus-specification.html#standard-interfaces-objectmanager)
interface).

Once an instance of this type has been created, you can connect to
the `Gio.DBusObjectManager.object-added` and
[signal@Gio.DBusObjectManager::object-removed signals] and inspect the
`Gio.DBusObjectProxy` objects returned by
`Gio.DBusObjectManager.getObjects()`.

If the name for a `GDBusObjectManagerClient` is not owned by anyone at
object construction time, the default behavior is to request the
message bus to launch an owner for the name. This behavior can be
disabled using the `G_DBUS_OBJECT_MANAGER_CLIENT_FLAGS_DO_NOT_AUTO_START`
flag. It’s also worth noting that this only works if the name of
interest is activatable in the first place. E.g. in some cases it
is not possible to launch an owner for the requested name. In this
case, `GDBusObjectManagerClient` object construction still succeeds but
there will be no object proxies
(e.g. `Gio.DBusObjectManager.getObjects()` returns the empty list) and
the `Gio.DBusObjectManagerClient.nameOwner` property is `NULL`.

The owner of the requested name can come and go (for example
consider a system service being restarted) – `GDBusObjectManagerClient`
handles this case too; simply connect to the `GObject.Object.notify`
signal to watch for changes on the
`Gio.DBusObjectManagerClient.nameOwner` property. When the name
owner vanishes, the behavior is that
`Gio.DBusObjectManagerClient.nameOwner` is set to `NULL` (this
includes emission of the `GObject.Object.notify` signal) and then
`Gio.DBusObjectManager.object-removed` signals are synthesized
for all currently existing object proxies. Since
`Gio.DBusObjectManagerClient.nameOwner` is `NULL` when this
happens, you can use this information to disambiguate a synthesized signal
from a genuine signal caused by object removal on the remote
`Gio.DBusObjectManager`. Similarly, when a new name owner appears,
`Gio.DBusObjectManager.object-added` signals are synthesized
while `Gio.DBusObjectManagerClient.nameOwner` is still `NULL`. Only
when all object proxies have been added, the
`Gio.DBusObjectManagerClient.nameOwner` is set to the new name
owner (this includes emission of the `GObject.Object.notify` signal).
Furthermore, you are guaranteed that
`Gio.DBusObjectManagerClient.nameOwner` will alternate between a
name owner (e.g. `:1.42`) and `NULL` even in the case where
the name of interest is atomically replaced

Ultimately, `GDBusObjectManagerClient` is used to obtain
`Gio.DBusProxy` instances. All signals (including the
`org.freedesktop.DBus.Properties::PropertiesChanged` signal)
delivered to `Gio.DBusProxy` instances are guaranteed to originate
from the name owner. This guarantee along with the behavior
described above, means that certain race conditions including the
“half the proxy is from the old owner and the other half is from
the new owner” problem cannot happen.

To avoid having the application connect to signals on the returned
`Gio.DBusObjectProxy` and `Gio.DBusProxy` objects, the
`Gio.DBusObject.interface-added`,
`Gio.DBusObject.interface-removed`,
`Gio.DBusProxy.g-properties-changed` and
`Gio.DBusProxy.g-signal` signals
are also emitted on the `GDBusObjectManagerClient` instance managing these
objects. The signals emitted are
`Gio.DBusObjectManager.interface-added`,
`Gio.DBusObjectManager.interface-removed`,
`Gio.DBusObjectManagerClient.interface-proxy-properties-changed` and
`Gio.DBusObjectManagerClient.interface-proxy-signal`.

Note that all callbacks and signals are emitted in the
thread-default main context (see
`GLib.MainContext.pushThreadDefault()`) that the
`GDBusObjectManagerClient` object was constructed in. Additionally, the
`Gio.DBusObjectProxy` and `Gio.DBusProxy` objects
originating from the `GDBusObjectManagerClient` object will be created in
the same context and, consequently, will deliver signals in the
same main loop.

```tsx
import { GDBusObjectManagerClient } from "@gtkx/jsx/gio";
```

## Hierarchy

[GObject](.gtkx/reference/gobject/object.md) → **GDBusObjectManagerClient**

Implements `GAsyncInitable`, `GDBusObjectManager`, `GInitable`.

## Static methods

Static methods are called on `Gio.DBusObjectManagerClient`, imported from `@gtkx/gi/gio`.

### `new`

```ts
new(connection: Gio.DBusConnection, flags: Gio.DBusObjectManagerClientFlags, name: string, objectPath: string, getProxyTypeFunc: Gio.DBusProxyTypeFunc | null, cancellable: Gio.Cancellable | null, callback: Gio.AsyncReadyCallback | null): void
```

Asynchronously creates a new `GDBusObjectManagerClient` object.

This is an asynchronous failable constructor. When the result is
ready, `callback` will be invoked in the thread-default main context
(see `GLib.MainContext.pushThreadDefault()`)
of the thread you are calling this method from. You can then call
`g_dbus_object_manager_client_new_finish()` to get the result. See
`g_dbus_object_manager_client_new_sync()` for the synchronous version.

**Parameters**

- `connection`: A `GDBusConnection`.
- `flags`: Zero or more flags from the `GDBusObjectManagerClientFlags` enumeration.
- `name`: The owner of the control object (unique or well-known name).
- `objectPath`: The object path of the control object.
- `getProxyTypeFunc`: A `GDBusProxyTypeFunc` function or `null` to always construct `GDBusProxy` proxies.
- `cancellable`: A `GCancellable` or `null`
- `callback`: A `GAsyncReadyCallback` to call when the request is satisfied.

_Available since 2.30._

### `newFinish`

```ts
newFinish(res: Gio.AsyncResult): Gio.DBusObjectManagerClient
```

Finishes an operation started with `g_dbus_object_manager_client_new()`.

**Parameters**

- `res`: A `GAsyncResult` obtained from the `GAsyncReadyCallback` passed to `g_dbus_object_manager_client_new()`.

**Returns** A
  `GDBusObjectManagerClient` object or `null` if `error` is set.

**Throws** A `GLib.Error` carrying the failing operation's domain, code, and message.

_Available since 2.30._

### `newForBus`

```ts
newForBus(busType: Gio.BusType, flags: Gio.DBusObjectManagerClientFlags, name: string, objectPath: string, getProxyTypeFunc: Gio.DBusProxyTypeFunc | null, cancellable: Gio.Cancellable | null, callback: Gio.AsyncReadyCallback | null): void
```

Like `g_dbus_object_manager_client_new()` but takes a `GBusType` instead of a
`GDBusConnection`.

This is an asynchronous failable constructor. When the result is
ready, `callback` will be invoked in the thread-default main context
(see `GLib.MainContext.pushThreadDefault()`)
of the thread you are calling this method from. You can
then call `g_dbus_object_manager_client_new_for_bus_finish()` to get the result. See
`g_dbus_object_manager_client_new_for_bus_sync()` for the synchronous version.

**Parameters**

- `busType`: A `GBusType`.
- `flags`: Zero or more flags from the `GDBusObjectManagerClientFlags` enumeration.
- `name`: The owner of the control object (unique or well-known name).

### `newForBusFinish`

```ts

- `res`: A `GAsyncResult` obtained from the `GAsyncReadyCallback` passed to `g_dbus_object_manager_client_new_for_bus()`.

**Returns** A
  `GDBusObjectManagerClient` object or `null` if `error` is set.

**Throws** A `GLib.Error` carrying the failing operation's domain, code, and message.

of a `GDBusConnection`.

This is a synchronous failable constructor - the calling thread is
blocked until a reply is received. See `g_dbus_object_manager_client_new_for_bus()`

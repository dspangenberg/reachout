# GApplicationCommandLine

`GApplicationCommandLine` represents a command-line invocation of
an application.

It is created by `Gio.Application` and emitted
in the `Gio.Application.command-line` signal and virtual function.

The class contains the list of arguments that the program was invoked
with. It is also possible to query if the commandline invocation was
local (ie: the current process is running in direct response to the
invocation) or remote (ie: some other process forwarded the
commandline to this process).

The `GApplicationCommandLine` object can provide the `argc` and `argv`
parameters for use with the `GLib.OptionContext` command-line parsing API,
with the `Gio.ApplicationCommandLine.getArguments()` function. See
[gapplication-example-cmdline3.c](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/glib/-/blob/HEAD/gio/tests/gapplication-example-cmdline3.c)
for an example.

The exit status of the originally-invoked process may be set and
messages can be printed to stdout or stderr of that process.

For remote invocation, the originally-invoked process exits when
`Gio.ApplicationCommandLine.done()` method is called. This method is
also automatically called when the object is disposed.

The main use for `GApplicationCommandLine` (and the
`Gio.Application.command-line` signal) is 'Emacs server' like use cases:
You can set the `EDITOR` environment variable to have e.g. git use
your favourite editor to edit commit messages, and if you already
have an instance of the editor running, the editing will happen
in the running instance, instead of opening a new one. An important
aspect of this use case is that the process that gets started by git
does not return until the editing is done.

Normally, the commandline is completely handled in the
`Gio.Application.command-line` handler. The launching instance exits
once the signal handler in the primary instance has returned, and
the return value of the signal handler becomes the exit status
of the launching instance.

```c
static int
command_line (GApplication            *application,
              GApplicationCommandLine *cmdline)
{
  gchar **argv;
  gint argc;
  gint i;

  argv = g_application_command_line_get_arguments (cmdline, &argc);

  g_application_command_line_print (cmdline,
                                    "This text is written back\n"
                                    "to stdout of the caller\n");

  for (i = 0; i < argc; i++)
    g_print ("argument %d: %s\n", i, argv[i]);

  g_strfreev (argv);

  return 0;
}
```

The complete example can be found here:
[gapplication-example-cmdline.c](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/glib/-/blob/HEAD/gio/tests/gapplication-example-cmdline.c)

In more complicated cases, the handling of the commandline can be
split between the launcher and the primary instance.

```c
static gboolean
 test_local_cmdline (GApplication   *application,
                     gchar        ***arguments,
                     gint           *exit_status)
{
  gint i, j;
  gchar **argv;

  argv = *arguments;

  if (argv[0] == NULL)
    {
      *exit_status = 0;
      return FALSE;
    }

  i = 1;
  while (argv[i])
    {
      if (g_str_has_prefix (argv[i], "--local-"))
        {
          g_print ("handling argument %s locally\n", argv[i]);
          g_free (argv[i]);
          for (j = i; argv[j]; j++)
            argv[j] = argv[j + 1];
        }
      else
        {
          g_print ("not handling argument %s locally\n", argv[i]);
          i++;
        }
    }

  *exit_status = 0;

  return FALSE;
}

static void
test_application_class_init (TestApplicationClass *class)
{
  G_APPLICATION_CLASS (class)->local_command_line = test_local_cmdline;

  ...
}
```

In this example of split commandline handling, options that start
with `--local-` are handled locally, all other options are passed
to the `Gio.Application.command-line` handler which runs in the primary
instance.

The complete example can be found here:
[gapplication-example-cmdline2.c](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/glib/-/blob/HEAD/gio/tests/gapplication-example-cmdline2.c)

If handling the commandline requires a lot of work, it may be better to defer it.

```c
static gboolean
my_cmdline_handler (gpointer data)
{
  GApplicationCommandLine *cmdline = data;

  // do the heavy lifting in an idle

  g_application_command_line_set_exit_status (cmdline, 0);
  g_object_unref (cmdline); // this releases the application

  return G_SOURCE_REMOVE;
}

static int
command_line (GApplication            *application,
              GApplicationCommandLine *cmdline)
{
  // keep the application running until we are done with this commandline
  g_application_hold (application);

  g_object_set_data_full (G_OBJECT (cmdline),
                          "application", application,
                          (GDestroyNotify)g_application_release);

  g_object_ref (cmdline);
  g_idle_add (my_cmdline_handler, cmdline);

  return 0;
}
```

In this example the commandline is not completely handled before
the `Gio.Application.command-line` handler returns. Instead, we keep
a reference to the `GApplicationCommandLine` object and handle it
later (in this example, in an idle). Note that it is necessary to
hold the application until you are done with the commandline.

import { GApplicationCommandLine } from "@gtkx/jsx/gio";

## Hierarchy

[GObject](.gtkx/reference/gobject/object.md) → **GApplicationCommandLine**

## Props

`ref` receives the `Gio.ApplicationCommandLine` instance. Every mutable property also has an `onNotify<Prop>` handler prop called with the new value when the property changes. Props inherited from ancestor elements are documented on their own pages.

### `arguments_`

`GLib.Variant` · construct-only

The commandline that caused this `Gio.Application.command-line`
signal emission.

_Available since 2.28._

### `isRemote`

`boolean` · default `false` · read-only, observe with `onNotifyIsRemote`

Whether this is a remote commandline.

_Available since 2.28._

### `options`

`GLib.Variant` · construct-only

The options sent along with the commandline.

_Available since 2.28._

### `platformData`

`GLib.Variant` · construct-only

Platform-specific data for the commandline.

_Available since 2.28._

## Methods

Methods are called on the `Gio.ApplicationCommandLine` instance, obtained with the `ref` prop or imported from `@gtkx/gi/gio`. Methods inherited from ancestors are documented on their own pages.

### `createFileForArg`

```ts
createFileForArg(arg: string): Gio.File
```

Creates a `GFile` corresponding to a filename that was given as part
of the invocation of `cmdline`.

This differs from `g_file_new_for_commandline_arg()` in that it
resolves relative pathnames using the current working directory of
the invoking process rather than the local process.

**Parameters**

- `arg`: an argument from `cmdline`

**Returns** a new `GFile`

_Available since 2.36._

### `done`

```ts
done(): void
```

Signals that command line processing is completed.

For remote invocation, it causes the invoking process to terminate.

For local invocation, it does nothing.

This method should be called in the `Gio.Application.command-line`
handler, after the exit status is set and all messages are printed.

After this call, `g_application_command_line_set_exit_status()` has no effect.
Subsequent calls to this method are no-ops.

This method is automatically called when the `GApplicationCommandLine`
object is disposed — so you can omit the call in non-garbage collected
languages.

_Available since 2.80._

### `getArguments`

```ts
getArguments(): string[]
```

Gets the list of arguments that was passed on the command line.

The strings in the array may contain non-UTF-8 data on UNIX (such as
filenames or arguments given in the system locale) but are always in
UTF-8 on Windows.

If you wish to use the return value with `GOptionContext`, you must
use `g_option_context_parse_strv()`.

**Returns** the string array containing the arguments (the argv)

_Available since 2.28._

### `getCwd`

```ts
getCwd(): string | null
```

Gets the working directory of the command line invocation.
The string may contain non-utf8 data.

It is possible that the remote application did not send a working
directory, so this may be `null`.

**Returns** the current directory, or `null`

_Available since 2.28._

### `getenv`

```ts
getenv(name: string): string | null
```

Gets the value of a particular environment variable of the command
line invocation, as would be returned by `g_getenv()`.  The strings may
contain non-utf8 data.

The remote application usually does not send an environment.  Use
`G_APPLICATION_SEND_ENVIRONMENT` to affect that.  Even with this flag
set it is possible that the environment is still not available (due
to invocation messages from other applications).

**Parameters**

- `name`: the environment variable to get

**Returns** the value of the variable, or `null` if unset or unsent

_Available since 2.28._

### `getEnviron`

```ts
getEnviron(): string[] | null
```

Gets the contents of the 'environ' variable of the command line
invocation, as would be returned by `g_get_environ()`, ie as a
`null`-terminated list of strings in the form 'NAME=VALUE'.
The strings may contain non-utf8 data.

The remote application usually does not send an environment.  Use
`G_APPLICATION_SEND_ENVIRONMENT` to affect that.  Even with this flag
set it is possible that the environment is still not available (due
to invocation messages from other applications).

See `g_application_command_line_getenv()` if you are only interested
in the value of a single environment variable.

**Returns** the environment strings, or `null` if they were not sent

_Available since 2.28._

### `getExitStatus`

```ts
getExitStatus(): number
```

Gets the exit status of `cmdline`.  See
`g_application_command_line_set_exit_status()` for more information.

**Returns** the exit status

_Available since 2.28._

### `getIsRemote`

```ts
getIsRemote(): boolean
```

Determines if `cmdline` represents a remote invocation.

**Returns** `true` if the invocation was remote

_Available since 2.28._

### `getOptionsDict`

```ts
getOptionsDict(): GLib.VariantDict
```

Gets the options that were passed to `g_application_command_line()`.

If you did not override `local_command_line()` then these are the same
options that were parsed according to the `GOptionEntrys` added to the
application with `g_application_add_main_option_entries()` and possibly
modified from your GApplication::handle-local-options handler.

If no options were sent then an empty dictionary is returned so that
you don't need to check for `null`.

The data has been passed via an untrusted external process, so the types of
all values must be checked before being used.

**Returns** a `GVariantDict` with the options

_Available since 2.40._

### `getPlatformData`

```ts
getPlatformData(): GLib.Variant | null
```

Gets the platform data associated with the invocation of `cmdline`.

This is a `GVariant` dictionary containing information about the
context in which the invocation occurred.  It typically contains
information like the current working directory and the startup
notification ID.

It comes from an untrusted external process and hence the types of all
values must be validated before being used.

For local invocation, it will be `null`.

**Returns** the platform data, or `null`

_Available since 2.28._

### `getStdin`

```ts
getStdin(): Gio.InputStream | null
```

Gets the stdin of the invoking process.

The `GInputStream` can be used to read data passed to the standard
input of the invoking process.
This doesn't work on all platforms.  Presently, it is only available
on UNIX when using a D-Bus daemon capable of passing file descriptors.
If stdin is not available then `null` will be returned.  In the
future, support may be expanded to other platforms.

You must only call this function once per commandline invocation.

**Returns** a `GInputStream` for stdin

_Available since 2.34._

### `printerrLiteral`

```ts
printerrLiteral(message: string): void
```

Prints a message using the stderr print handler in the invoking process.

Unlike `g_application_command_line_printerr()`, `message` is not
a `printf()`-style format string. Use this function if `message` contains text
you don't have control over, that could include `printf()` escape sequences.

**Parameters**

- `message`: the message

_Available since 2.80._

### `printLiteral`

```ts
printLiteral(message: string): void
```

Prints a message using the stdout print handler in the invoking process.

Unlike `g_application_command_line_print()`, `message` is not a `printf()`-style
format string. Use this function if `message` contains text you don't have
control over, that could include `printf()` escape sequences.

**Parameters**

- `message`: the message

_Available since 2.80._

### `setExitStatus`

```ts
setExitStatus(exitStatus: number): void
```

Sets the exit status that will be used when the invoking process
exits.

The return value of the `GApplication.command-line` signal is
passed to this function when the handler returns.  This is the usual
way of setting the exit status.

In the event that you want the remote invocation to continue running
and want to decide on the exit status in the future, you can use this
call.  For the case of a remote invocation, the remote process will
typically exit when the last reference is dropped on `cmdline`.  The
exit status of the remote process will be equal to the last value
that was set with this function.

In the case that the commandline invocation is local, the situation
is slightly more complicated.  If the commandline invocation results
in the mainloop running (ie: because the use-count of the application
increased to a non-zero value) then the application is considered to
have been 'successful' in a certain sense, and the exit status is
always zero.  If the application use count is zero, though, the exit
status of the local `GApplicationCommandLine` is used.

This method is a no-op if `g_application_command_line_done()` has
been called.

**Parameters**

- `exitStatus`: the exit status

_Available since 2.28._

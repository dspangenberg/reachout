# GApplication

`GApplication` is the core class for application support.

A `GApplication` is the foundation of an application. It wraps some
low-level platform-specific services and is intended to act as the
foundation for higher-level application classes such as
`GtkApplication` or `MxApplication`. In general, you should not use
this class outside of a higher level framework.

`GApplication` provides convenient life-cycle management by maintaining
a "use count" for the primary application instance. The use count can
be changed using `Gio.Application.hold()` and
`Gio.Application.release()`. If it drops to zero, the application
exits. Higher-level classes such as `GtkApplication` employ the use count
to ensure that the application stays alive as long as it has any opened
windows.

Another feature that `GApplication` (optionally) provides is process
uniqueness. Applications can make use of this functionality by
providing a unique application ID. If given, only one application
with this ID can be running at a time per session. The session
concept is platform-dependent, but corresponds roughly to a graphical
desktop login. When your application is launched again, its
arguments are passed through platform communication to the already
running program. The already running instance of the program is
called the "primary instance"; for non-unique applications this is
always the current instance. On Linux, the D-Bus session bus
is used for communication.

The use of `GApplication` differs from some other commonly-used
uniqueness libraries (such as libunique) in important ways. The
application is not expected to manually register itself and check
if it is the primary instance. Instead, the `main()` function of a
`GApplication` should do very little more than instantiating the
application instance, possibly connecting signal handlers, then
calling `Gio.Application.run()`. All checks for uniqueness are done
internally. If the application is the primary instance then the
startup signal is emitted and the mainloop runs. If the application
is not the primary instance then a signal is sent to the primary
instance and `Gio.Application.run()` promptly returns. See the code
examples below.

If used, the expected form of an application identifier is the
same as that of a
[D-Bus well-known bus name](https://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus-specification.html#message-protocol-names-bus).
Examples include: `com.example.MyApp`, `org.example.internal_apps.Calculator`,
`org._7_zip.Archiver`.
For details on valid application identifiers, see `Gio.Application.idIsValid()`.

On Linux, the application identifier is claimed as a well-known bus name
on the user's session bus. This means that the uniqueness of your
application is scoped to the current session. It also means that your
application may provide additional services (through registration of other
object paths) at that bus name. The registration of these object paths
should be done with the shared GDBus session bus. Note that due to the
internal architecture of GDBus, method calls can be dispatched at any time
(even if a main loop is not running). For this reason, you must ensure that
any object paths that you wish to register are registered before `GApplication`
attempts to acquire the bus name of your application (which happens in
`Gio.Application.register()`). Unfortunately, this means that you cannot
use `Gio.Application.isRemote` to decide if you want to register
object paths.

`GApplication` also implements the `Gio.ActionGroup` and `Gio.ActionMap`
interfaces and lets you easily export actions by adding them with
`Gio.ActionMap.addAction()`. When invoking an action by calling
`Gio.ActionGroup.activateAction()` on the application, it is always
invoked in the primary instance. The actions are also exported on
the session bus, and GIO provides the `Gio.DBusActionGroup` wrapper to
conveniently access them remotely. GIO provides a `Gio.DBusMenuModel` wrapper
for remote access to exported `Gio.MenuModel`s.

Note: Due to the fact that actions are exported on the session bus,
using `maybe` parameters is not supported, since D-Bus does not support
`maybe` types.

There is a number of different entry points into a `GApplication`:

- via 'Activate' (i.e. just starting the application)

- via 'Open' (i.e. opening some files)

- by handling a command-line

- via activating an action

The `Gio.Application.startup` signal lets you handle the application
initialization for all of these in a single place.

Regardless of which of these entry points is used to start the
application, `GApplication` passes some ‘platform data’ from the
launching instance to the primary instance, in the form of a
`GLib.Variant` dictionary mapping strings to variants. To use platform
data, override the `Gio.Application.beforeEmit()` or
`Gio.Application.afterEmit()` virtual functions
in your `GApplication` subclass. When dealing with
`Gio.ApplicationCommandLine` objects, the platform data is
directly available via `Gio.ApplicationCommandLine.getCwd()`,
`Gio.ApplicationCommandLine.getEnviron()` and
`Gio.ApplicationCommandLine.getPlatformData()`.

As the name indicates, the platform data may vary depending on the
operating system, but it always includes the current directory (key
`cwd`), and optionally the environment (ie the set of environment
variables and their values) of the calling process (key `environ`).
The environment is only added to the platform data if the
`G_APPLICATION_SEND_ENVIRONMENT` flag is set. `GApplication` subclasses
can add their own platform data by overriding the
`Gio.Application.addPlatformData()` virtual function. For instance,
`GtkApplication` adds startup notification data in this way.

To parse commandline arguments you may handle the
`Gio.Application.command-line` signal or override the
`Gio.Application.localCommandLine()` virtual function, to parse them in
either the primary instance or the local instance, respectively.

For an example of opening files with a `GApplication`, see
[gapplication-example-open.c](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/glib/-/blob/HEAD/gio/tests/gapplication-example-open.c).

For an example of using actions with `GApplication`, see
[gapplication-example-actions.c](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/glib/-/blob/HEAD/gio/tests/gapplication-example-actions.c).

For an example of using extra D-Bus hooks with `GApplication`, see
[gapplication-example-dbushooks.c](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/glib/-/blob/HEAD/gio/tests/gapplication-example-dbushooks.c).

_Available since 2.28._

```tsx
import { GApplication } from "@gtkx/jsx/gio";
```

## Hierarchy

[GObject](.gtkx/reference/gobject/object.md) → **GApplication**

Implements `GActionGroup`, `GActionMap`.

## Static methods

Static methods are called on `Gio.Application`, imported from `@gtkx/gi/gio`.

### `getDefault`

```ts
getDefault(): Gio.Application | null
```

Returns the default `GApplication` instance for this process.

Normally there is only one `GApplication` per process and it becomes
the default when it is created.  You can exercise more control over
this by using `g_application_set_default()`.

If there is no default application then `null` is returned.

**Returns** the default application for this process, or `null`

_Available since 2.32._

### `idIsValid`

```ts
idIsValid(applicationId: string): boolean
```

Checks if `application_id` is a valid application identifier.

A valid ID is required for calls to `g_application_new()` and
`g_application_set_application_id()`.

Application identifiers follow the same format as
[D-Bus well-known bus names](https://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus-specification.html#message-protocol-names-bus).
For convenience, the restrictions on application identifiers are
reproduced here:

- Application identifiers are composed of 1 or more elements separated by a
  period (`.`) character. All elements must contain at least one character.

- Each element must only contain the ASCII characters `[A-Z][a-z][0-9]_-`,
  with `-` discouraged in new application identifiers. Each element must not
  begin with a digit.

- Application identifiers must contain at least one `.` (period) character
  (and thus at least two elements).

- Application identifiers must not begin with a `.` (period) character.

- Application identifiers must not exceed 255 characters.

Note that the hyphen (`-`) character is allowed in application identifiers,
but is problematic or not allowed in various specifications and APIs that
refer to D-Bus, such as
[Flatpak application IDs](http://docs.flatpak.org/en/latest/introduction.html#identifiers),
the
[`DBusActivatable` interface in the Desktop Entry Specification](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/desktop-entry-spec-latest.html#dbus),
and the convention that an application's "main" interface and object path
resemble its application identifier and bus name. To avoid situations that
require special-case handling, it is recommended that new application
identifiers consistently replace hyphens with underscores.

Like D-Bus interface names, application identifiers should start with the
reversed DNS domain name of the author of the interface (in lower-case), and
it is conventional for the rest of the application identifier to consist of
words run together, with initial capital letters.

As with D-Bus interface names, if the author's DNS domain name contains
hyphen/minus characters they should be replaced by underscores, and if it
contains leading digits they should be escaped by prepending an underscore.
For example, if the owner of 7-zip.org used an application identifier for an
archiving application, it might be named `org._7_zip.Archiver`.

**Parameters**

- `applicationId`: a potential application identifier

**Returns** `true` if `application_id` is valid

### `new`

```ts
new(applicationId: string | null, flags: Gio.ApplicationFlags): Gio.Application
```

Creates a new `GApplication` instance.

If non-`null`, the application id must be valid.  See
`g_application_id_is_valid()`.

If no application ID is given then some features of `GApplication`
(most notably application uniqueness) will be disabled.

**Parameters**

- `applicationId`: the application id
- `flags`: the application flags

**Returns** a new `GApplication` instance

## Props

`ref` receives the `Gio.Application` instance. Every mutable property also has an `onNotify<Prop>` handler prop called with the new value when the property changes. Props inherited from ancestor elements are documented on their own pages.

### `actionGroup`

`Gio.ActionGroup | ReactElement` · deprecated since 2.32

The group of actions that the application exports.

> **Deprecated since 2.32.** Use the `Gio.ActionMap` interface instead. Never ever mix use of this API with use of `GActionMap` on the same `application` or things will go very badly wrong.

_Available since 2.28._

### `actions`

The human-readable version number of the application.

_Available since 2.80._

## Signals

### `onActionAdded`

```ts
(actionName: string, self: Gio.Application) => void
```

From `GActionGroup`.

Signals that a new action was just added to the group.

This signal is emitted after the action has been added
and is now visible.

**Parameters**

- `actionName`: the name of the action in `action_group`
- `self`: The instance the signal was emitted on.

_Available since 2.28._

### `onActionEnabledChanged`

```ts
(actionName: string, enabled: boolean, self: Gio.Application) => void
```

From `GActionGroup`.

Signals that the enabled status of the named action has changed.

**Parameters**

- `actionName`: the name of the action in `action_group`
- `enabled`: whether the action is enabled
- `self`: The instance the signal was emitted on.

_Available since 2.28._

### `onActionRemoved`

```ts
(actionName: string, self: Gio.Application) => void
```

From `GActionGroup`.

Signals that an action is just about to be removed from the group.

This signal is emitted before the action is removed, so the action
is still visible and can be queried from the signal handler.

**Parameters**

- `actionName`: the name of the action in `action_group`
- `self`: The instance the signal was emitted on.

_Available since 2.28._

### `onActionStateChanged`

```ts
(actionName: string, value: GLib.Variant, self: Gio.Application) => void
```

From `GActionGroup`.

Signals that the state of the named action has changed.

**Parameters**

- `actionName`: the name of the action in `action_group`
- `value`: the new value of the state
- `self`: The instance the signal was emitted on.

_Available since 2.28._

### `onActivate`

```ts
(self: Gio.Application) => void
```

The ::activate signal is emitted on the primary instance when an
activation occurs. See `g_application_activate()`.

**Parameters**

- `self`: The instance the signal was emitted on.

### `onCommandLine`

```ts
(commandLine: Gio.ApplicationCommandLine, self: Gio.Application) => number | undefined
```

The ::command-line signal is emitted on the primary instance when
a commandline is not handled locally. See `g_application_run()` and
the `GApplicationCommandLine` documentation for more information.

**Parameters**

- `commandLine`: a `GApplicationCommandLine` representing the passed commandline
- `self`: The instance the signal was emitted on.

**Returns** An integer that is set as the exit status for the calling
  process. See `g_application_command_line_set_exit_status()`.

### `onHandleLocalOptions`

```ts
(options: GLib.VariantDict, self: Gio.Application) => number | undefined
```

The ::handle-local-options signal is emitted on the local instance
after the parsing of the commandline options has occurred.

You can add options to be recognised during commandline option
parsing using `g_application_add_main_option_entries()` and
`g_application_add_option_group()`.

Signal handlers can inspect `options` (along with values pointed to
from the `arg_data` of an installed `GOptionEntrys`) in order to
decide to perform certain actions, including direct local handling
(which may be useful for options like --version).

In the event that the application is marked
`G_APPLICATION_HANDLES_COMMAND_LINE` the "normal processing" will
send the `options` dictionary to the primary instance where it can be
read with `g_application_command_line_get_options_dict()`.  The signal
handler can modify the dictionary before returning, and the
modified dictionary will be sent.

In the event that `G_APPLICATION_HANDLES_COMMAND_LINE` is not set,
"normal processing" will treat the remaining uncollected command
line arguments as filenames or URIs.  If there are no arguments,
the application is activated by `g_application_activate()`.  One or
more arguments results in a call to `g_application_open()`.

If you want to handle the local commandline arguments for yourself
by converting them to calls to `g_application_open()` or
`g_action_group_activate_action()` then you must be sure to register
the application first.  You should probably not call
`g_application_activate()` for yourself, however: just return -1 and
allow the default handler to do it for you.  This will ensure that
the `--gapplication-service` switch works properly (i.e. no activation
in that case).

Note that this signal is emitted from the default implementation of
`local_command_line()`.  If you override that function and don't
chain up then this signal will never be emitted.

You can override `local_command_line()` if you need more powerful
capabilities than what is provided here, but this should not
normally be required.

**Parameters**

- `options`: the options dictionary
- `self`: The instance the signal was emitted on.

**Returns** an exit code. If you have handled your options and want
to exit the process, return a non-negative option, 0 for success,
and a positive value for failure. To continue, return -1 to let
the default option processing continue.

_Available since 2.40._

### `onNameLost`

```ts
(self: Gio.Application) => boolean | undefined
```

The ::name-lost signal is emitted only on the registered primary instance
when a new instance has taken over. This can only happen if the application
is using the `G_APPLICATION_ALLOW_REPLACEMENT` flag.

The default handler for this signal calls `g_application_quit()`.

**Parameters**

- `self`: The instance the signal was emitted on.

**Returns** `true` if the signal has been handled

_Available since 2.60._

### `onOpen`

```ts
(files: Gio.File[], nFiles: number, hint: string, self: Gio.Application) => void
```

The ::open signal is emitted on the primary instance when there are
files to open. See `g_application_open()` for more information.

**Parameters**

- `files`: an array of `GFiles`
- `nFiles`: the length of `files`
- `hint`: a hint provided by the calling instance
- `self`: The instance the signal was emitted on.

### `onShutdown`

```ts
(self: Gio.Application) => void
```

The ::shutdown signal is emitted only on the registered primary instance
immediately after the main loop terminates.

**Parameters**

- `self`: The instance the signal was emitted on.

### `onStartup`

```ts
(self: Gio.Application) => void
```

The ::startup signal is emitted on the primary instance immediately
after registration. See `g_application_register()`.

**Parameters**

- `self`: The instance the signal was emitted on.

## Methods

Methods are called on the `Gio.Application` instance, obtained with the `ref` prop or imported from `@gtkx/gi/gio`. Methods inherited from ancestors are documented on their own pages.

### `activate`

```ts
activate(): void
```

Activates the application.

In essence, this results in the `GApplication.activate` signal being
emitted in the primary instance.

The application must be registered before calling this function.

_Available since 2.28._

### `addMainOption`

```ts
addMainOption(longName: string, shortName: number, flags: GLib.OptionFlags, arg: GLib.OptionArg, description: string, argDescription: string | null): void
```

Add an option to be handled by `application`.

Calling this function is the equivalent of calling
`g_application_add_main_option_entries()` with a single `GOptionEntry`
that has its arg_data member set to `null`.

The parsed arguments will be packed into a `GVariantDict` which
is passed to `GApplication.handle-local-options`. If
`G_APPLICATION_HANDLES_COMMAND_LINE` is set, then it will also
be sent to the primary instance. See
`g_application_add_main_option_entries()` for more details.

See `GOptionEntry` for more documentation of the arguments.

**Parameters**

- `longName`: the long name of an option used to specify it in a commandline
- `shortName`: the short name of an option
- `flags`: flags from `GOptionFlags`
- `arg`: the type of the option, as a `GOptionArg`
- `description`: the description for the option in `--help` output
- `argDescription`: the placeholder to use for the extra argument parsed by the option in `--help` output

_Available since 2.42._

### `addMainOptionEntries`

```ts
addMainOptionEntries(entries: GLib.OptionEntry[]): void
```

Adds main option entries to be handled by `application`.

This function is comparable to `g_option_context_add_main_entries()`.

After the commandline arguments are parsed, the
`GApplication.handle-local-options` signal will be emitted.  At this
point, the application can inspect the values pointed to by `arg_data`
in the given `GOptionEntrys`.

Unlike `GOptionContext`, `GApplication` supports giving a `null`
`arg_data` for a non-callback `GOptionEntry`.  This results in the
argument in question being packed into a `GVariantDict` which is also
passed to `GApplication.handle-local-options`, where it can be
inspected and modified.  If `G_APPLICATION_HANDLES_COMMAND_LINE` is
set, then the resulting dictionary is sent to the primary instance,
where `g_application_command_line_get_options_dict()` will return it.
As it has been passed outside the process at this point, the types of all
values in the options dict must be checked before being used.
This "packing" is done according to the type of the argument --
booleans for normal flags, strings for strings, bytestrings for
filenames, etc.  The packing only occurs if the flag is given (ie: we
do not pack a "false" `GVariant` in the case that a flag is missing).

In general, it is recommended that all commandline arguments are
parsed locally.  The options dictionary should then be used to
transmit the result of the parsing to the primary instance, where
`g_variant_dict_lookup()` can be used.  For local options, it is
possible to either use `arg_data` in the usual way, or to consult (and
potentially remove) the option from the options dictionary.

This function is new in GLib 2.40.  Before then, the only real choice
was to send all of the commandline arguments (options and all) to the
primary instance for handling.  `GApplication` ignored them completely
on the local side.  Calling this function "opts in" to the new
behaviour, and in particular, means that unrecognized options will be
treated as errors.  Unrecognized options have never been ignored when
`G_APPLICATION_HANDLES_COMMAND_LINE` is unset.

If `GApplication.handle-local-options` needs to see the list of
filenames, then the use of `G_OPTION_REMAINING` is recommended.  If
`arg_data` is `null` then `G_OPTION_REMAINING` can be used as a key into
the options dictionary.  If you do use `G_OPTION_REMAINING` then you
need to handle these arguments for yourself because once they are
consumed, they will no longer be visible to the default handling
(which treats them as filenames to be opened).

It is important to use the proper GVariant format when retrieving
the options with `g_variant_dict_lookup()`:
- for `G_OPTION_ARG_NONE`, use `b`
- for `G_OPTION_ARG_STRING`, use `&s`
- for `G_OPTION_ARG_INT`, use `i`
- for `G_OPTION_ARG_INT64`, use `x`
- for `G_OPTION_ARG_DOUBLE`, use `d`
- for `G_OPTION_ARG_FILENAME`, use `^&ay`
- for `G_OPTION_ARG_STRING_ARRAY`, use `^a&s`
- for `G_OPTION_ARG_FILENAME_ARRAY`, use `^a&ay`

**Parameters**

- `entries`: the main options for the application

_Available since 2.40._

### `addOptionGroup`

```ts
addOptionGroup(group: GLib.OptionGroup): void
```

Adds a `GOptionGroup` to the commandline handling of `application`.

This function is comparable to `g_option_context_add_group()`.

Unlike `g_application_add_main_option_entries()`, this function does
not deal with `null` `arg_data` and never transmits options to the
primary instance.

The reason for that is because, by the time the options arrive at the
primary instance, it is typically too late to do anything with them.
Taking the GTK option group as an example: GTK will already have been
initialised by the time the `GApplication.command-line` handler runs.
In the case that this is not the first-running instance of the
application, the existing instance may already have been running for
a very long time.

This means that the options from `GOptionGroup` are only really usable
in the case that the instance of the application being run is the
first instance.  Passing options like `--display=` or `--gdk-debug=`
on future runs will have no effect on the existing primary instance.

Calling this function will cause the options in the supplied option
group to be parsed, but it does not cause you to be "opted in" to the
new functionality whereby unrecognized options are rejected even if
`G_APPLICATION_HANDLES_COMMAND_LINE` was given.

**Parameters**

- `group`: a `GOptionGroup`

_Available since 2.40._

### `bindBusyProperty`

```ts
bindBusyProperty(object: GObject.Object, property: string): void
```

Marks `application` as busy (see `g_application_mark_busy()`) while
`property` on `object` is `true`.

The binding holds a reference to `application` while it is active, but
not to `object`. Instead, the binding is destroyed when `object` is
finalized.

**Parameters**

- `object`: a `GObject`
- `property`: the name of a boolean property of `object`

_Available since 2.44._

### `getApplicationId`

```ts
getApplicationId(): string | null
```

Gets the unique identifier for `application`.

**Returns** the identifier for `application`, owned by `application`

_Available since 2.28._

### `getDbusConnection`

```ts
getDbusConnection(): Gio.DBusConnection | null
```

Gets the `GDBusConnection` being used by the application, or `null`.

If `GApplication` is using its D-Bus backend then this function will
return the `GDBusConnection` being used for uniqueness and
communication with the desktop environment and other instances of the
application.

If `GApplication` is not using D-Bus then this function will return
`null`.  This includes the situation where the D-Bus backend would
normally be in use but we were unable to connect to the bus.

This function must not be called before the application has been
registered.  See `g_application_get_is_registered()`.

**Returns** a `GDBusConnection`, or `null`

_Available since 2.34._

### `getDbusObjectPath`

```ts
getDbusObjectPath(): string | null
```

Gets the D-Bus object path being used by the application, or `null`.

If `GApplication` is using its D-Bus backend then this function will
return the D-Bus object path that `GApplication` is using.  If the
application is the primary instance then there is an object published
at this path.  If the application is not the primary instance then
the result of this function is undefined.

If `GApplication` is not using D-Bus then this function will return
`null`.  This includes the situation where the D-Bus backend would
normally be in use but we were unable to connect to the bus.

This function must not be called before the application has been
registered.  See `g_application_get_is_registered()`.

**Returns** the object path, or `null`

_Available since 2.34._

### `getFlags`

```ts
getFlags(): Gio.ApplicationFlags
```

Gets the flags for `application`.

See `GApplicationFlags`.

**Returns** the flags for `application`

_Available since 2.28._

### `getInactivityTimeout`

```ts
getInactivityTimeout(): number
```

Gets the current inactivity timeout for the application.

This is the amount of time (in milliseconds) after the last call to
`g_application_release()` before the application stops running.

**Returns** the timeout, in milliseconds

_Available since 2.28._

### `getIsBusy`

```ts
getIsBusy(): boolean
```

Gets the application's current busy state, as set through
`g_application_mark_busy()` or `g_application_bind_busy_property()`.

**Returns** `true` if `application` is currently marked as busy

_Available since 2.44._

### `getIsRegistered`

```ts
getIsRegistered(): boolean
```

Checks if `application` is registered.

An application is registered if `g_application_register()` has been
successfully called.

**Returns** `true` if `application` is registered

_Available since 2.28._

### `getIsRemote`

```ts
getIsRemote(): boolean
```

Checks if `application` is remote.

If `application` is remote then it means that another instance of
application already exists (the 'primary' instance).  Calls to
perform actions on `application` will result in the actions being
performed by the primary instance.

The value of this property cannot be accessed before
`g_application_register()` has been called.  See
`g_application_get_is_registered()`.

**Returns** `true` if `application` is remote

_Available since 2.28._

### `getResourceBasePath`

```ts
getResourceBasePath(): string | null
```

Gets the resource base path of `application`.

See `g_application_set_resource_base_path()` for more information.

**Returns** the base resource path, if one is set

_Available since 2.42._

### `getVersion`

```ts
getVersion(): string | null
```

Gets the version of `application`.

**Returns** the version of `application`

_Available since 2.80._

### `hold`

```ts
hold(): void
```

Increases the use count of `application`.

Use this function to indicate that the application has a reason to
continue to run.  For example, `g_application_hold()` is called by GTK
when a toplevel window is on the screen.

To cancel the hold, call `g_application_release()`.

### `markBusy`

```ts
markBusy(): void
```

Increases the busy count of `application`.

Use this function to indicate that the application is busy, for instance
while a long running operation is pending.

The busy state will be exposed to other processes, so a session shell will
use that information to indicate the state to the user (e.g. with a
spinner).

To cancel the busy indication, use `g_application_unmark_busy()`.

The application must be registered before calling this function.

_Available since 2.38._

### `open`

```ts
open(files: Gio.File[], hint: string): void
```

Opens the given files.

In essence, this results in the `GApplication.open` signal being emitted
in the primary instance.

`n_files` must be greater than zero.

`hint` is simply passed through to the ::open signal.  It is
intended to be used by applications that have multiple modes for
opening files (eg: "view" vs "edit", etc).  Unless you have a need
for this functionality, you should use "".

The application must be registered before calling this function
and it must have the `G_APPLICATION_HANDLES_OPEN` flag set.

**Parameters**

- `files`: an array of `GFiles` to open
- `hint`: a hint (or ""), but never `null`

_Available since 2.28._

### `quit`

```ts
quit(): void
```

Immediately quits the application.

Upon return to the mainloop, `g_application_run()` will return,
calling only the 'shutdown' function before doing so.

The hold count is ignored.
Take care if your code has called `g_application_hold()` on the application and
is therefore still expecting it to exist.
(Note that you may have called `g_application_hold()` indirectly, for example
through `gtk_application_add_window()`.)

The result of calling `g_application_run()` again after it returns is
unspecified.

_Available since 2.32._

### `register`

```ts
register(cancellable: Gio.Cancellable | null): boolean
```

Attempts registration of the application.

This is the point at which the application discovers if it is the
primary instance or merely acting as a remote for an already-existing
primary instance.  This is implemented by attempting to acquire the
application identifier as a unique bus name on the session bus using
GDBus.

If there is no application ID or if `G_APPLICATION_NON_UNIQUE` was
given, then this process will always become the primary instance.

Due to the internal architecture of GDBus, method calls can be
dispatched at any time (even if a main loop is not running).  For
this reason, you must ensure that any object paths that you wish to
register are registered before calling this function.

If the application has already been registered then `true` is
returned with no work performed.

The `GApplication.startup` signal is emitted if registration succeeds
and `application` is the primary instance (including the non-unique
case).

In the event of an error (such as `cancellable` being cancelled, or a
failure to connect to the session bus), `false` is returned and `error`
is set appropriately.

Note: the return value of this function is not an indicator that this
instance is or is not the primary instance of the application.  See
`g_application_get_is_remote()` for that.

**Parameters**

- `cancellable`: a `GCancellable`, or `null`

**Returns** `true` if registration succeeded

**Throws** A `GLib.Error` carrying the failing operation's domain, code, and message.

_Available since 2.28._

### `release`

```ts
release(): void
```

Decrease the use count of `application`.

When the use count reaches zero, the application will stop running.

Never call this function except to cancel the effect of a previous
call to `g_application_hold()`.

### `run`

```ts
run(argv: string[] | null): number
```

Runs the application.

This function is intended to be run from `main()` and its return value
is intended to be returned by `main()`. Although you are expected to pass
the `argc`, `argv` parameters from `main()` to this function, it is possible
to pass `null` if `argv` is not available or commandline handling is not
required.  Note that on Windows, `argc` and `argv` are ignored, and
`g_win32_get_command_line()` is called internally (for proper support
of Unicode commandline arguments).

`GApplication` will attempt to parse the commandline arguments.  You
can add commandline flags to the list of recognised options by way of
`g_application_add_main_option_entries()`.  After this, the
`GApplication.handle-local-options` signal is emitted, from which the
application can inspect the values of its `GOptionEntrys`.

`GApplication.handle-local-options` is a good place to handle options
such as `--version`, where an immediate reply from the local process is
desired (instead of communicating with an already-running instance).
A `GApplication.handle-local-options` handler can stop further processing
by returning a non-negative value, which then becomes the exit status of
the process.

What happens next depends on the flags: if
`G_APPLICATION_HANDLES_COMMAND_LINE` was specified then the remaining
commandline arguments are sent to the primary instance, where a
`GApplication.command-line` signal is emitted.  Otherwise, the
remaining commandline arguments are assumed to be a list of files.
If there are no files listed, the application is activated via the
`GApplication.activate` signal.  If there are one or more files, and
`G_APPLICATION_HANDLES_OPEN` was specified then the files are opened
via the `GApplication.open` signal.

If you are interested in doing more complicated local handling of the
commandline then you should implement your own `GApplication` subclass
and override `local_command_line()`. In this case, you most likely want
to return `true` from your `local_command_line()` implementation to
suppress the default handling. See
[gapplication-example-cmdline2.c](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/glib/-/blob/HEAD/gio/tests/gapplication-example-cmdline2.c)
for an example.

If, after the above is done, the use count of the application is zero
then the exit status is returned immediately.  If the use count is
non-zero then the default main context is iterated until the use count
falls to zero, at which point 0 is returned.

If the `G_APPLICATION_IS_SERVICE` flag is set, then the service will
run for as much as 10 seconds with a use count of zero while waiting
for the message that caused the activation to arrive.  After that,
if the use count falls to zero the application will exit immediately,
except in the case that `g_application_set_inactivity_timeout()` is in
use.

This function sets the prgname (`g_set_prgname()`), if not already set,
to the basename of argv[0].

Much like `g_main_loop_run()`, this function will acquire the main context
for the duration that the application is running.

Since 2.40, applications that are not explicitly flagged as services
or launchers (ie: neither `G_APPLICATION_IS_SERVICE` or
`G_APPLICATION_IS_LAUNCHER` are given as flags) will check (from the
default handler for local_command_line) if "--gapplication-service"
was given in the command line.  If this flag is present then normal
commandline processing is interrupted and the
`G_APPLICATION_IS_SERVICE` flag is set.  This provides a "compromise"
solution whereby running an application directly from the commandline
will invoke it in the normal way (which can be useful for debugging)
while still allowing applications to be D-Bus activated in service
mode.  The D-Bus service file should invoke the executable with
"--gapplication-service" as the sole commandline argument.  This
approach is suitable for use by most graphical applications but
should not be used from applications like editors that need precise
control over when processes invoked via the commandline will exit and
what their exit status will be.

**Parameters**

- `argv`: the argv from `main()`, or `null`

**Returns** the exit status

_Available since 2.28._

### `sendNotification`

```ts
sendNotification(id: string | null, notification: Gio.Notification): void
```

Sends a notification on behalf of `application` to the desktop shell.
There is no guarantee that the notification is displayed immediately,
or even at all.

Notifications may persist after the application exits. It will be
D-Bus-activated when the notification or one of its actions is
activated.

Modifying `notification` after this call has no effect. However, the
object can be reused for a later call to this function.

`id` may be any string that uniquely identifies the event for the
application. It does not need to be in any special format. For
example, "new-message" might be appropriate for a notification about
new messages.

If a previous notification was sent with the same `id`, it will be
replaced with `notification` and shown again as if it was a new
notification. This works even for notifications sent from a previous
execution of the application, as long as `id` is the same string.

`id` may be `NULL`, but it is impossible to replace or withdraw
notifications without an id.

If `notification` is no longer relevant, it can be withdrawn with
`Gio.Application.withdrawNotification()`.

It is an error to call this function if `application` has no
application ID.

**Parameters**

- `id`: id of the notification, or `null`
- `notification`: the `GNotification` to send

_Available since 2.40._

### `setActionGroup`

```ts
setActionGroup(actionGroup: Gio.ActionGroup | null): void
```

This used to be how actions were associated with a `GApplication`.
Now there is `GActionMap` for that.

**Parameters**

- `actionGroup`: a `GActionGroup`, or `null`

> **Deprecated since 2.32.** Use the `GActionMap` interface instead. Never ever mix use of this API with use of `GActionMap` on the same `application` or things will go very badly wrong. This function is known to introduce buggy behaviour (ie: signals not emitted on changes to the action group), so you should really use `GActionMap` instead.

_Available since 2.28._

### `setApplicationId`

```ts
setApplicationId(applicationId: string | null): void
```

Sets the unique identifier for `application`.

The application id can only be modified if `application` has not yet
been registered.

If non-`null`, the application id must be valid.  See
`g_application_id_is_valid()`.

**Parameters**

- `applicationId`: the identifier for `application`

_Available since 2.28._

### `setDefault`

```ts
setDefault(): void
```

Sets or unsets the default application for the process, as returned
by `g_application_get_default()`.

This function does not take its own reference on `application`.  If
`application` is destroyed then the default application will revert
back to `null`.

_Available since 2.32._

### `setFlags`

```ts
setFlags(flags: Gio.ApplicationFlags): void
```

Sets the flags for `application`.

The flags can only be modified if `application` has not yet been
registered.

See `GApplicationFlags`.

**Parameters**

- `flags`: the flags for `application`

_Available since 2.28._

### `setInactivityTimeout`

```ts
setInactivityTimeout(inactivityTimeout: number): void
```

Sets the current inactivity timeout for the application.

This is the amount of time (in milliseconds) after the last call to
`g_application_release()` before the application stops running.

This call has no side effects of its own.  The value set here is only
used for next time `g_application_release()` drops the use count to
zero.  Any timeouts currently in progress are not impacted.

**Parameters**

- `inactivityTimeout`: the timeout, in milliseconds

_Available since 2.28._

### `setOptionContextDescription`

```ts
setOptionContextDescription(description: string | null): void
```

Adds a description to the `application` option context.

See `g_option_context_set_description()` for more information.

**Parameters**

- `description`: a string to be shown in `--help` output after the list of options, or `null`

_Available since 2.56._

### `setOptionContextParameterString`

```ts
setOptionContextParameterString(parameterString: string | null): void
```

Sets the parameter string to be used by the commandline handling of `application`.

This function registers the argument to be passed to `g_option_context_new()`
when the internal `GOptionContext` of `application` is created.

See `g_option_context_new()` for more information about `parameter_string`.

**Parameters**

- `parameterString`: a string which is displayed in the first line of `--help` output, after the usage summary `programname [OPTION...]`.

_Available since 2.56._

### `setOptionContextSummary`

```ts
setOptionContextSummary(summary: string | null): void
```

Adds a summary to the `application` option context.

See `g_option_context_set_summary()` for more information.

**Parameters**

- `summary`: a string to be shown in `--help` output before the list of options, or `null`

_Available since 2.56._

### `setResourceBasePath`

```ts
setResourceBasePath(resourcePath: string | null): void
```

Sets (or unsets) the base resource path of `application`.

The path is used to automatically load various
[application resources]`Gio.Resource` such as menu layouts and
action descriptions. The various types of resources will be found at
fixed names relative to the given base path.

By default, the resource base path is determined from the application
ID by prefixing '/' and replacing each '.' with '/'.  This is done at
the time that the `GApplication` object is constructed.  Changes to
the application ID after that point will not have an impact on the
resource base path.

As an example, if the application has an ID of "org.example.app" then
the default resource base path will be "/org/example/app".  If this
is a `GtkApplication` (and you have not manually changed the path)
then Gtk will then search for the menus of the application at
"/org/example/app/gtk/menus.ui".

See `GResource` for more information about adding resources to your
application.

You can disable automatic resource loading functionality by setting
the path to `null`.

Changing the resource base path once the application is running is
not recommended.  The point at which the resource path is consulted
for forming paths for various purposes is unspecified.  When writing
a sub-class of `GApplication` you should either set the
`GApplication.resourceBasePath` property at construction time, or call
this function during the instance initialization. Alternatively, you
can call this function in the `GApplicationClass`.startup virtual function,
before chaining up to the parent implementation.

**Parameters**

- `resourcePath`: the resource path to use

_Available since 2.42._

### `setVersion`

```ts
setVersion(version: string): void
```

Sets the version number of `application`. This will be used to implement
a `--version` command line argument

The application version can only be modified if `application` has not yet
been registered.

**Parameters**

- `version`: the version of `application`

_Available since 2.80._

### `unbindBusyProperty`

```ts
unbindBusyProperty(object: GObject.Object, property: string): void
```

Destroys a binding between `property` and the busy state of
`application` that was previously created with
`g_application_bind_busy_property()`.

**Parameters**

- `object`: a `GObject`
- `property`: the name of a boolean property of `object`

_Available since 2.44._

### `unmarkBusy`

```ts
unmarkBusy(): void
```

Decreases the busy count of `application`.

When the busy count reaches zero, the new state will be propagated
to other processes.

This function must only be called to cancel the effect of a previous
call to `g_application_mark_busy()`.

_Available since 2.38._

### `withdrawNotification`

```ts
withdrawNotification(id: string): void
```

Withdraws a notification that was sent with
`g_application_send_notification()`.

This call does nothing if a notification with `id` doesn't exist or
the notification was never sent.

This function works even for notifications sent in previous
executions of this application, as long `id` is the same as it was for
the sent notification.

Note that notifications are dismissed when the user clicks on one
of the buttons in a notification or triggers its default action, so
there is no need to explicitly withdraw the notification in that case.

**Parameters**

- `id`: id of a previously sent notification

_Available since 2.40._

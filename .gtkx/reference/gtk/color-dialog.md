# GtkColorDialog

Asynchronous API to present a color chooser dialog.

`GtkColorDialog` collects the arguments that are needed to present
the dialog to the user, such as a title for the dialog and whether
it should be modal.

The dialog is shown with the `Gtk.ColorDialog.chooseRgba()`
function.

See `Gtk.ColorDialogButton` for a convenient control
that uses `GtkColorDialog` and presents the results.

_Available since 4.10._

```tsx
import { GtkColorDialog } from "@gtkx/jsx/gtk";
```

## Hierarchy

[GObject](.gtkx/reference/gobject/object.md) → **GtkColorDialog**

## Static methods

Static methods are called on `Gtk.ColorDialog`, imported from `@gtkx/gi/gtk`.

### `new`

```ts
new(): Gtk.ColorDialog
```

Creates a new `GtkColorDialog` object.

**Returns** the new `GtkColorDialog`

_Available since 4.10._

## Props

`ref` receives the `Gtk.ColorDialog` instance. Every mutable property also has an `onNotify<Prop>` handler prop called with the new value when the property changes. Props inherited from ancestor elements are documented on their own pages.

### `modal`

`boolean` · default `true`

Whether the color chooser dialog is modal.

_Available since 4.10._

### `title`

`string` · default `null`

A title that may be shown on the color chooser dialog.

_Available since 4.10._

### `withAlpha`

`boolean` · default `true`

Whether colors may have alpha (translucency).

When with-alpha is false, the color that is selected
will be forced to have alpha == 1.

_Available since 4.10._

## Methods

Methods are called on the `Gtk.ColorDialog` instance, obtained with the `ref` prop or imported from `@gtkx/gi/gtk`. Methods inherited from ancestors are documented on their own pages.

### `chooseRgbaFinish`

```ts
chooseRgbaFinish(result: Gio.AsyncResult): Gdk.RGBA
```

Finishes the `Gtk.ColorDialog.chooseRgba()` call

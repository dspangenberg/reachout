# GtkFixedLayout

Places child widgets at fixed positions.

Most applications should never use this layout manager; fixed positioning
and sizing requires constant recalculations on where children need to be
positioned and sized. Other layout managers perform this kind of work
internally so that application developers don't need to do it. Specifically,
widgets positioned in a fixed layout manager will need to take into account:

- Themes, which may change widget sizes.

- Fonts other than the one you used to write the app will of course
  change the size of widgets containing text; keep in mind that
  users may use a larger font because of difficulty reading the
  default, or they may be using a different OS that provides different
  fonts.

- Translation of text into other languages changes its size. Also,
  display of non-English text will use a different font in many
  cases.

In addition, `GtkFixedLayout` does not pay attention to text direction and
thus may produce unwanted results if your app is run under right-to-left
languages such as Hebrew or Arabic. That is: normally GTK will order
containers appropriately depending on the text direction, e.g. to put labels
to the right of the thing they label when using an RTL language;
`GtkFixedLayout` won't be able to do that for you.

Finally, fixed positioning makes it kind of annoying to add/remove UI
elements, since you have to reposition all the other  elements. This is a
long-term maintenance problem for your application.

```tsx
import { GtkFixedLayout } from "@gtkx/jsx/gtk";
```

## Hierarchy

[GObject](.gtkx/reference/gobject/object.md) → [GtkLayoutManager](.gtkx/reference/gtk/layout-manager.md) → **GtkFixedLayout**

## Static methods

Static methods are called on `Gtk.FixedLayout`, imported from `@gtkx/gi/gtk`.

### `new`

```ts
new(): Gtk.LayoutManager
```

Creates a new `GtkFixedLayout`.

**Returns** the newly created `GtkFixedLayout`

## Props

`ref` receives the `Gtk.FixedLayout` instance. Every mutable property also has an `onNotify<Prop>` handler prop called with the new value when the property changes. Props inherited from ancestor elements are documented on their own pages.

# GtkBuilder

Reads XML descriptions of a user interface and instantiates the described objects.

To create a `GtkBuilder` from a user interface description, call
`Gtk.Builder.newFromFile()`, `Gtk.Builder.newFromResource()`
or `Gtk.Builder.newFromString()`.

In the (unusual) case that you want to add user interface
descriptions from multiple sources to the same `GtkBuilder` you can
call `Gtk.Builder.new()` to get an empty builder and populate it by
(multiple) calls to `Gtk.Builder.addFromFile()`,
`Gtk.Builder.addFromResource()` or
`Gtk.Builder.addFromString()`.

A `GtkBuilder` holds a reference to all objects that it has constructed
and drops these references when it is finalized. This finalization can
cause the destruction of non-widget objects or widgets which are not
contained in a toplevel window. For toplevel windows constructed by a
builder, it is the responsibility of the user to call
`Gtk.Window.destroy()` to get rid of them and all the widgets
they contain.

The functions `Gtk.Builder.getObject()` and
`Gtk.Builder.getObjects()` can be used to access the widgets in
the interface by the names assigned to them inside the UI description.
Toplevel windows returned by these functions will stay around until the
user explicitly destroys them with `Gtk.Window.destroy()`. Other
widgets will either be part of a larger hierarchy constructed by the
builder (in which case you should not have to worry about their lifecycle),
or without a parent, in which case they have to be added to some container
to make use of them. Non-widget objects need to be reffed with
`g_object_ref()` to keep them beyond the lifespan of the builder.

### GtkBuilder UI Definitions

`GtkBuilder` parses textual descriptions of user interfaces which are
specified in XML format. We refer to these descriptions as “GtkBuilder
UI definitions” or just “UI definitions” if the context is clear.

#### Structure of UI definitions

UI definition files are always encoded in UTF-8.

The toplevel element is `<interface>`. It optionally takes a “domain”
attribute, which will make the builder look for translated strings
using `dgettext()` in the domain specified. This can also be done by
calling `Gtk.Builder.setTranslationDomain()` on the builder.
For example:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<interface domain="your-app">
  ...
</interface>
```

#### Requirements

The target toolkit version(s) are described by `<requires>` elements,
the “lib” attribute specifies the widget library in question (currently
the only supported value is “gtk”) and the “version” attribute specifies
the target version in the form “`<major>`.`<minor>`”. `GtkBuilder` will
error out if the version requirements are not met. For example:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<interface domain="your-app">
  <requires lib="gtk" version="4.0" />
</interface>
```

#### Objects

Objects are defined as children of the `<interface>` element.

Objects are described by `<object>` elements, which can contain
`<property>` elements to set properties, `<signal>` elements which
connect signals to handlers, and `<child>` elements, which describe
child objects.

Typically, the specific kind of object represented by an `<object>`
element is specified by the “class” attribute. If the type has not
been loaded yet, GTK tries to find the `get_type()` function from the
class name by applying heuristics. This works in most cases, but if
necessary, it is possible to specify the name of the `get_type()`
function explicitly with the "type-func" attribute. If your UI definition
is referencing internal types, you should make sure to call
`g_type_ensure()` for each object type before parsing the UI definition.

Objects may be given a name with the “id” attribute, which allows the
application to retrieve them from the builder with
`Gtk.Builder.getObject()`. An id is also necessary to use the
object as property value in other parts of the UI definition. GTK
reserves ids starting and ending with `___` (three consecutive
underscores) for its own purposes.

#### Properties

Setting properties of objects is pretty straightforward with the
`<property>` element: the “name” attribute specifies the name of the
property, and the content of the element specifies the value:

```xml
<object class="GtkButton">
  <property name="label">Hello, world</property>
</object>
```

If the “translatable” attribute is set to a true value, GTK uses
`gettext()` (or `dgettext()` if the builder has a translation domain set)
to find a translation for the value. This happens before the value
is parsed, so it can be used for properties of any type, but it is
probably most useful for string properties. It is also possible to
specify a context to disambiguate short strings, and comments which
may help the translators:

```xml
<object class="GtkButton">
  <property name="label"
            translatable="yes"
            context="button"
            comments="A classic">Hello, world</property>
</object>
```

The xgettext tool that is part of gettext can extract these strings,
but note that it only looks for translatable="yes".

`GtkBuilder` can parse textual representations for the most common
property types:

- characters
- strings
- integers
- floating-point numbers
- booleans (strings like “TRUE”, “t”, “yes”, “y”, “1” are interpreted
  as true values, strings like “FALSE”, “f”, “no”, “n”, “0” are interpreted
  as false values)
- string lists (separated by newlines)
- enumeration types (can be specified by their full C identifier their short
  name used when registering the enumeration type, or their integer value)
- flag types (can be specified by their C identifier or short name,
  optionally combined with “|” for bitwise OR, or a single integer value
  e.g., “GTK_INPUT_HINT_EMOJI|GTK_INPUT_HINT_LOWERCASE”, or “emoji|lowercase” or 520).
- colors (in the format understood by `Gdk.RGBA.parse()`)
- transforms (in the format understood by `Gsk.Transform.parse()`)
- Pango attribute lists (in the format understood by `Pango.AttrList.toString()`)
- Pango tab arrays (in the format understood by `Pango.TabArray.toString()`)
- Pango font descriptions (in the format understood by `Pango.FontDescription.fromString()`)
- `GVariant` (in the format understood by `GLib.Variant.parse()`)
- textures (can be specified as an object id, a resource path or a filename of an image file to load relative to the Builder file or the CWD if `Gtk.Builder.addFromString()` was used)
- GFile (like textures, can be specified as an object id, a URI or a filename of a file to load relative to the Builder file or the CWD if `Gtk.Builder.addFromString()` was used)

Objects can be referred to by their name and by default refer to
objects declared in the local XML fragment and objects exposed via
`Gtk.Builder.exposeObject()`. In general, `GtkBuilder` allows
forward references to objects declared in the local XML; an object
doesn’t have to be constructed before it can be referred to. The
exception to this rule is that an object has to be constructed before
it can be used as the value of a construct-only property.

#### Child objects

Many widgets have properties for child widgets, such as
`Gtk.Expander.child`. In this case, the preferred way to
specify the child widget in a ui file is to simply set the property:

```xml
<object class="GtkExpander">
  <property name="child">
    <object class="GtkLabel">
    ...
    </object>
  </property>
</object>
```

Generic containers that can contain an arbitrary number of children,
such as `Gtk.Box` instead use the `<child>` element. A `<child>`
element contains an `<object>` element which describes the child object.
Most often, child objects are widgets inside a container, but they can
also be, e.g., actions in an action group, or columns in a tree model.

Any object type that implements the `Gtk.Buildable` interface can
specify how children may be added to it. Since many objects and widgets that
are included with GTK already implement the `GtkBuildable` interface,
typically child objects can be added using the `<child>` element without
having to be concerned about the underlying implementation.

See the [`GtkWidget` documentation](class.Widget.html#gtkwidget-as-gtkbuildable)
for many examples of using `GtkBuilder` with widgets, including setting
child objects using the `<child>` element.

A noteworthy special case to the general rule that only objects implementing
`GtkBuildable` may specify how to handle the `<child>` element is that
`GtkBuilder` provides special support for adding objects to a
`Gio.ListStore` by using the `<child>` element. For instance:

```xml
<object class="GListStore">
  <property name="item-type">MyObject</property>
  <child>
    <object class="MyObject" />
  </child>
  ...
</object>
```

#### Property bindings

It is also possible to bind a property value to another object's
property value using the attributes "bind-source" to specify the
source object of the binding, and optionally, "bind-property" and
"bind-flags" to specify the source property and source binding flags
respectively. Internally, `GtkBuilder` implements this using
`GObject.Binding` objects.

For instance, in the example below the “label” property of the
`bottom_label` widget is bound to the “label” property of the
`top_button` widget:

```xml
<object class="GtkBox">
  <property name="orientation">vertical</property>
  <child>
    <object class="GtkButton" id="top_button">
      <property name="label">Hello, world</property>
    </object>
  </child>
  <child>
    <object class="GtkLabel" id="bottom_label">
      <property name="label"
                bind-source="top_button"
                bind-property="label"
                bind-flags="sync-create" />
    </object>
  </child>
</object>
```

For more information, see the documentation of the
`GObject.Object.bindProperty()` method.

Please note that another way to set up bindings between objects in .ui files
is to use the `GtkExpression` methodology. See the
[`GtkExpression` documentation](class.Expression.html#gtkexpression-in-ui-files)
for more information.

#### Internal children

Sometimes it is necessary to refer to widgets which have implicitly
been constructed by GTK as part of a composite widget, to set
properties on them or to add further children (e.g. the content area
of a `GtkDialog`). This can be achieved by setting the “internal-child”
property of the `<child>` element to a true value. Note that `GtkBuilder`
still requires an `<object>` element for the internal child, even if it
has already been constructed.

#### Specialized children

A number of widgets have different places where a child can be added
(e.g. tabs vs. page content in notebooks). This can be reflected in
a UI definition by specifying the “type” attribute on a `<child>`
The possible values for the “type” attribute are described in the
sections describing the widget-specific portions of UI definitions.

#### Signal handlers and function pointers

Signal handlers are set up with the `<signal>` element. The “name”
attribute specifies the name of the signal, and the “handler” attribute
specifies the function to connect to the signal.

```xml
<object class="GtkButton" id="hello_button">
  <signal name="clicked" handler="hello_button__clicked" />
</object>
```

The remaining attributes, “after”, “swapped” and “object”, have the
same meaning as the corresponding parameters of the
`GObject.signalConnectObject()` or `GObject.signalConnectData()`
functions:

- “after” matches the `G_CONNECT_AFTER` flag, and will ensure that the
  handler is called after the default class closure for the signal
- “swapped” matches the `G_CONNECT_SWAPPED` flag, and will swap the
  instance and closure arguments when invoking the signal handler
- “object” will bind the signal handler to the lifetime of the object
  referenced by the attribute

By default "swapped" will be set to "yes" if not specified otherwise, in
the case where "object" is set, for convenience. A “last_modification_time”
attribute is also allowed, but it does not have a meaning to the builder.

When compiling applications for Windows, you must declare signal callbacks
with the `G_MODULE_EXPORT` decorator, or they will not be put in the symbol
table:

```c
G_MODULE_EXPORT void
hello_button__clicked (GtkButton *button,
                       gpointer data)
{
  // ...
}
```

On Linux and Unix, this is not necessary; applications should instead
be compiled with the `-Wl,--export-dynamic` argument inside their compiler
flags, and linked against `gmodule-export-2.0`.

### Example UI Definition

```xml
<interface>
  <object class="GtkDialog" id="dialog1">
    <child internal-child="content_area">
      <object class="GtkBox">
        <child internal-child="action_area">
          <object class="GtkBox">
            <child>
              <object class="GtkButton" id="ok_button">
                <property name="label" translatable="yes">_Ok</property>
                <property name="use-underline">True</property>
                <signal name="clicked" handler="ok_button_clicked"/>
              </object>
            </child>
          </object>
        </child>
      </object>
    </child>
  </object>
</interface>
```

### Using GtkBuildable for extending UI definitions

Objects can implement the `Gtk.Buildable` interface to add custom
elements and attributes to the XML. Typically, any extension will be
documented in each type that implements the interface.

### Menus

In addition to objects with properties that are created with `<object>` and
`<property>` elements, `GtkBuilder` also allows to parse XML menu definitions
as used by `Gio.Menu` when exporting menu models over D-Bus, and as
described in the `Gtk.PopoverMenu` documentation. Menus can be defined
as toplevel elements, or as property values for properties of type `GMenuModel`.

### Templates

When describing a `Gtk.Widget`, you can use the `<template>` tag to
describe a UI bound to a specific widget type. GTK will automatically load
the UI definition when instantiating the type, and bind children and
signal handlers to instance fields and function symbols.

For more information, see the [`GtkWidget` documentation](class.Widget.html#building-composite-widgets-from-template-xml)
for details.

```tsx
import { GtkBuilder } from "@gtkx/jsx/gtk";
```

## Hierarchy

[GObject](.gtkx/reference/gobject/object.md) → **GtkBuilder**

## Props

`ref` receives the `Gtk.Builder` instance. Every mutable property also has an `onNotify<Prop>` handler prop called with the new value when the property changes. Props inherited from ancestor elements are documented on their own pages.

### `currentObject`

`GObject.Object | ReactElement`

The object the builder is evaluating for.

### `scope`

`Gtk.BuilderScope | ReactElement`

The scope the builder is operating in

### `translationDomain`

`string` · default `null`

The translation domain used when translating property values that
have been marked as translatable.

If the translation domain is `null`, `GtkBuilder` uses `gettext()`,
otherwise `g_dgettext()`.

## Methods

Methods are called on the `Gtk.Builder` instance, obtained with the `ref` prop or imported from `@gtkx/gi/gtk`. Methods inherited from ancestors are documented on their own pages.

### `addFromFile`

```ts
addFromFile(filename: string): boolean
```

Parses a file containing a UI definition and merges it with
the current contents of `builder`.

This function is useful if you need to call
`Gtk.Builder.setCurrentObject()`) to add user data to
callbacks before loading GtkBuilder UI. Otherwise, you probably
want `Gtk.Builder.newFromFile()` instead.

If an error occurs, 0 will be returned and `error` will be assigned a
`GError` from the `GTK_BUILDER_ERROR`, `G_MARKUP_ERROR` or `G_FILE_ERROR`
domains.

It’s not really reasonable to attempt to handle failures of this
call. You should not use this function with untrusted files (ie:
files that are not part of your application). Broken `GtkBuilder`
files can easily crash your program, and it’s possible that memory
was leaked leading up to the reported failure. The only reasonable
thing to do when an error is detected is to call `g_error()`.

**Parameters**

- `filename`: the name of the file to parse

**Returns** `true` on success, `false` if an error occurred

**Throws** A `GLib.Error` carrying the failing operation's domain, code, and message.

### `addFromResource`

```ts
addFromResource(resourcePath: string): boolean
```

Parses a resource file containing a UI definition
and merges it with the current contents of `builder`.

This function is useful if you need to call
`Gtk.Builder.setCurrentObject()` to add user data to
callbacks before loading GtkBuilder UI. Otherwise, you probably
want `Gtk.Builder.newFromResource()` instead.

If an error occurs, 0 will be returned and `error` will be assigned a
`GError` from the `GTK_BUILDER_ERROR`, `G_MARKUP_ERROR` or `G_RESOURCE_ERROR`
domain.

It’s not really reasonable to attempt to handle failures of this
call.  The only reasonable thing to do when an error is detected is
to call `g_error()`.

**Parameters**

- `resourcePath`: the path of the resource file to parse

**Returns** `true` on success, `false` if an error occurred

**Throws** A `GLib.Error` carrying the failing operation's domain, code, and message.

### `addFromString`

```ts
addFromString(buffer: string, length: number): boolean
```

Parses a string containing a UI definition and merges it
with the current contents of `builder`.

This function is useful if you need to call
`Gtk.Builder.setCurrentObject()` to add user data to
callbacks before loading `GtkBuilder` UI. Otherwise, you probably
want `Gtk.Builder.newFromString()` instead.

Upon errors `false` will be returned and `error` will be assigned a
`GError` from the `GTK_BUILDER_ERROR`, `G_MARKUP_ERROR` or
`G_VARIANT_PARSE_ERROR` domain.

It’s not really reasonable to attempt to handle failures of this
call.  The only reasonable thing to do when an error is detected is
to call `g_error()`.

**Parameters**

- `buffer`: the string to parse
- `length`: the length of `buffer` (may be -1 if `buffer` is nul-terminated)

**Returns** `true` on success, `false` if an error occurred

**Throws** A `GLib.Error` carrying the failing operation's domain, code, and message.

### `addObjectsFromFile`

```ts
addObjectsFromFile(filename: string, objectIds: string[]): boolean
```

Parses a file containing a UI definition building only the
requested objects and merges them with the current contents
of `builder`.

Upon errors, 0 will be returned and `error` will be assigned a
`GError` from the `GTK_BUILDER_ERROR`, `G_MARKUP_ERROR` or `G_FILE_ERROR`
domain.

If you are adding an object that depends on an object that is not
its child (for instance a `GtkTreeView` that depends on its
`GtkTreeModel`), you have to explicitly list all of them in `object_ids`.

**Parameters**

- `filename`: the name of the file to parse
- `objectIds`: nul-terminated array of objects to build

**Returns** `true` on success, `false` if an error occurred

**Throws** A `GLib.Error` carrying the failing operation's domain, code, and message.

### `addObjectsFromResource`

```ts
addObjectsFromResource(resourcePath: string, objectIds: string[]): boolean
```

Parses a resource file containing a UI definition, building
only the requested objects and merges them with the current
contents of `builder`.

Upon errors, 0 will be returned and `error` will be assigned a
`GError` from the `GTK_BUILDER_ERROR`, `G_MARKUP_ERROR` or `G_RESOURCE_ERROR`
domain.

If you are adding an object that depends on an object that is not
its child (for instance a `GtkTreeView` that depends on its
`GtkTreeModel`), you have to explicitly list all of them in `object_ids`.

**Parameters**

- `resourcePath`: the path of the resource file to parse
- `objectIds`: nul-terminated array of objects to build

**Returns** `true` on success, `false` if an error occurred

**Throws** A `GLib.Error` carrying the failing operation's domain, code, and message.

### `addObjectsFromString`

```ts
addObjectsFromString(buffer: string, length: number, objectIds: string[]): boolean
```

Parses a string containing a UI definition, building only the
requested objects and merges them with the current contents of
`builder`.

Upon errors `false` will be returned and `error` will be assigned a
`GError` from the `GTK_BUILDER_ERROR` or `G_MARKUP_ERROR` domain.

If you are adding an object that depends on an object that is not
its child (for instance a `GtkTreeView` that depends on its
`GtkTreeModel`), you have to explicitly list all of them in `object_ids`.

**Parameters**

- `buffer`: the string to parse
- `length`: the length of `buffer` (may be -1 if `buffer` is nul-terminated)
- `objectIds`: nul-terminated array of objects to build

**Returns** `true` on success, `false` if an error occurred

**Throws** A `GLib.Error` carrying the failing operation's domain, code, and message.

### `createClosure`

```ts
createClosure(functionName: string, flags: Gtk.BuilderClosureFlags, object: GObject.Object | null): GObject.Closure | null
```

Creates a closure to invoke the function called `function_name`.

This is using the `create_closure()` implementation of `builder`'s
`Gtk.BuilderScope`.

If no closure could be created, `null` will be returned and `error`
will be set.

**Parameters**

- `functionName`: name of the function to look up
- `flags`: closure creation flags
- `object`: Object to create the closure with

**Returns** A new closure for invoking `function_name`

**Throws** A `GLib.Error` carrying the failing operation's domain, code, and message.

### `exposeObject`

```ts
exposeObject(name: string, object: GObject.Object): void
```

Add `object` to the `builder` object pool so it can be
referenced just like any other object built by builder.

Only a single object may be added using `name`. However,
it is not an error to expose the same object under multiple
names. `gtk_builder_get_object()` may be used to determine
if an object has already been added with `name`.

**Parameters**

- `name`: the name of the object exposed to the builder
- `object`: the object to expose

### `extendWithTemplate`

```ts
extendWithTemplate(object: GObject.Object, templateType: bigint | AnyClass<TypedClass>, buffer: string, length: number): boolean
```

Main private entry point for building composite components
from template XML.

Most likely you do not need to call this function in applications as
templates are handled by `GtkWidget`.

**Parameters**

- `object`: the object that is being extended
- `templateType`: the type that the template is for
- `buffer`: the string to parse
- `length`: the length of `buffer` (may be -1 if `buffer` is nul-terminated)

**Returns** A positive value on success, 0 if an error occurred

**Throws** A `GLib.Error` carrying the failing operation's domain, code, and message.

### `getCurrentObject`

```ts
getCurrentObject(): GObject.Object | null
```

Gets the current object set via `gtk_builder_set_current_object()`.

**Returns** the current object

### `getObject`

```ts
getObject(name: string): GObject.Object | null
```

Gets the object named `name`.

Note that this function does not increment the reference count
of the returned object.

**Parameters**

- `name`: name of object to get

**Returns** the object named `name`

### `getObjects`

```ts
getObjects(): GObject.Object[]
```

Gets all objects that have been constructed by `builder`.

Note that this function does not increment the reference
counts of the returned objects.

**Returns** a
  newly-allocated `GSList` containing all the objects
  constructed by the `GtkBuilder instance`. It should be
  freed by `g_slist_free()`

### `getScope`

```ts
getScope(): Gtk.BuilderScope
```

Gets the scope in use that was set via `gtk_builder_set_scope()`.

**Returns** the current scope

### `getTranslationDomain`

```ts
getTranslationDomain(): string | null
```

Gets the translation domain of `builder`.

**Returns** the translation domain

### `getTypeFromName`

```ts
getTypeFromName(typeName: string): bigint
```

Looks up a type by name.

This is using the virtual function that `GtkBuilder` has
for that purpose. This is mainly used when implementing
the `GtkBuildable` interface on a type.

**Parameters**

- `typeName`: type name to lookup

**Returns** the `GType` found for `type_name` or `G_TYPE_INVALID`
  if no type was found

### `setCurrentObject`

```ts
setCurrentObject(currentObject: GObject.Object | null): void
```

Sets the current object for the `builder`.

The current object can be thought of as the `this` object that the
builder is working for and will often be used as the default object
when an object is optional.

`Gtk.Widget.initTemplate()` for example will set the current
object to the widget the template is inited for. For functions like
`Gtk.Builder.newFromResource()`, the current object will be `null`.

**Parameters**

- `currentObject`: the new current object

### `setScope`

```ts
setScope(scope: Gtk.BuilderScope | null): void
```

Sets the scope the builder should operate in.

If `scope` is `null`, a new `Gtk.BuilderCScope` will be created.

**Parameters**

- `scope`: the scope to use

### `setTranslationDomain`

```ts
setTranslationDomain(domain: string | null): void
```

Sets the translation domain of `builder`.

**Parameters**

- `domain`: the translation domain

### `valueFromString`

```ts
valueFromString(pspec: GObject.ParamSpec, string: string): [boolean, unknown]
```

Demarshals a value from a string.

This function calls `g_value_init()` on the `value` argument,
so it need not be initialised beforehand.

Can handle char, uchar, boolean, int, uint, long,
ulong, enum, flags, float, double, string, `GdkRGBA` and
`GtkAdjustment` type values.

Upon errors `false` will be returned and `error` will be
assigned a `GError` from the `GTK_BUILDER_ERROR` domain.

**Parameters**

- `pspec`: the `GParamSpec` for the property
- `string`: the string representation of the value

**Returns** Tuple of:

- `result`: `true` on success
- `value`: the `GValue` to store the result in

**Throws** A `GLib.Error` carrying the failing operation's domain, code, and message.

### `valueFromStringType`

```ts
valueFromStringType(type: bigint | AnyClass<TypedClass>, string: string): [boolean, unknown]
```

Demarshals a value from a string.

Unlike `Gtk.Builder.valueFromString()`, this function
takes a `GType` instead of `GParamSpec`.

Calls `g_value_init()` on the `value` argument, so it
need not be initialised beforehand.

Upon errors `false` will be returned and `error` will be
assigned a `GError` from the `GTK_BUILDER_ERROR` domain.

**Parameters**

- `type`: the `GType` of the value
- `string`: the string representation of the value

**Returns** Tuple of:

- `result`: `true` on success
- `value`: the `GValue` to store the result in

**Throws** A `GLib.Error` carrying the failing operation's domain, code, and message.

# GtkWindowGroup

Creates groups of windows that behave like separate applications.

It achieves this by limiting the effect of GTK grabs and modality
to windows in the same group.

A window can be a member in at most one window group at a time.
Windows that have not been explicitly assigned to a group are
implicitly treated like windows of the default window group.

 If the
windows in the window group are subsequently destroyed, then they will
be removed from the window group and drop their references on the window
group; when all window have been removed, the window group will be
freed.

```tsx
import { GtkWindowGroup } from "@gtkx/jsx/gtk";
```

## Hierarchy

[GObject](.gtkx/reference/gobject/object.md) → **GtkWindowGroup**

## Static methods

Static methods are called on `Gtk.WindowGroup`, imported from `@gtkx/gi/gtk`.

### `new`

```ts
new(): Gtk.WindowGroup
```

Creates a new `GtkWindowGroup` object.

Modality of windows only affects windows
within the same `GtkWindowGroup`.

**Returns** a new `GtkWindowGroup`.

## Props

`ref` receives the `Gtk.WindowGroup` instance. Every mutable property also has an `onNotify<Prop>` handler prop called with the new value when the property changes. Props inherited from ancestor elements are documented on their own pages.

## Methods

Methods are called on the `Gtk.WindowGroup` instance, obtained with the `ref` prop or imported from `@gtkx/gi/gtk`. Methods inherited from ancestors are documented on their own pages.

### `addWindow`

```ts
addWindow(window: Gtk.Window): void
```

Adds a window to a `GtkWindowGroup`.

**Parameters**

- `window`: the `GtkWindow` to add

### `listWindows`

```ts
listWindows(): Gtk.Window[]
```

Returns a list of the `GtkWindows` that belong to `window_group`.

**Returns** A
  newly-allocated list of windows inside the group.

### `removeWindow`

```ts
removeWindow(window: Gtk.Window): void
```

Removes a window from a `GtkWindowGroup`.

**Parameters**

- `window`: the `GtkWindow` to remove

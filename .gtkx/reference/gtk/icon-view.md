# GtkIconView

`GtkIconView` is a widget which displays data in a grid of icons.



`GtkIconView` provides an alternative view on a `GtkTreeModel`.
It displays the model as a grid of icons with labels. Like
`Gtk.TreeView`, it allows to select one or multiple items
(depending on the selection mode, see `Gtk.IconView.setSelectionMode()`).
In addition to selection with the arrow keys, `GtkIconView` supports
rubberband selection, which is controlled by dragging the pointer.

Note that if the tree model is backed by an actual tree store (as
opposed to a flat list where the mapping to icons is obvious),
`GtkIconView` will only display the first level of the tree and
ignore the tree’s branches.

### CSS nodes

```
iconview.view
╰── [rubberband]
```

`GtkIconView` has a single CSS node with name iconview and style class .view.
For rubberband selection, a subnode with name rubberband is used.

> **Deprecated since 4.10.** Use `Gtk.GridView` instead

```tsx
import { GtkIconView } from "@gtkx/jsx/gtk";
```

## Hierarchy

[GObject](.gtkx/reference/gobject/object.md) → [GInitiallyUnowned](.gtkx/reference/gobject/initially-unowned.md) → [GtkWidget](.gtkx/reference/gtk/widget.md) → **GtkIconView**

Implements `GtkAccessible`, `GtkBuildable`, `GtkCellLayout`, `GtkConstraintTarget`, `GtkScrollable`.

## Props

`ref` receives the `Gtk.IconView` instance. Every mutable property also has an `onNotify<Prop>` handler prop called with the new value when the property changes. Props inherited from ancestor elements are documented on their own pages.

### `activateOnSingleClick`

`boolean` · default `false`

The activate-on-single-click property specifies whether the "item-activated" signal
will be emitted after a single click.

### `cellArea`

`Gtk.CellArea` · construct-only

The `GtkCellArea` used to layout cell renderers for this view.

If no area is specified when creating the icon view with `gtk_icon_view_new_with_area()`
a `GtkCellAreaBox` will be used.

### `columns`

`number` · default `-1`

The columns property contains the number of the columns in which the
items should be displayed. If it is -1, the number of columns will
be chosen automatically to fill the available area.

### `columnSpacing`

`number` · default `6`

The column-spacing property specifies the space which is inserted between
the columns of the icon view.

### `hadjustment`

`Gtk.Adjustment | ReactElement` · from `GtkScrollable`

Horizontal `GtkAdjustment` of the scrollable widget.

This adjustment is shared between the scrollable widget and its parent.

### `hscrollPolicy`

`Gtk.ScrollablePolicy` · default `GTK_SCROLL_MINIMUM` · from `GtkScrollable`

Determines when horizontal scrolling should start.

### `itemOrientation`

`Gtk.Orientation` · default `GTK_ORIENTATION_VERTICAL`

The item-orientation property specifies how the cells (i.e. the icon and
the text) of the item are positioned relative to each other.

### `itemPadding`

`number` · default `6`

The item-padding property specifies the padding around each
of the icon view's item.

### `itemWidth`

`number` · default `-1`

The item-width property specifies the width to use for each item.
If it is set to -1, the icon view will automatically determine a
suitable item size.

### `margin`

`number` · default `6`

The margin property specifies the space which is inserted
at the edges of the icon view.

### `markupColumn`

`number` · default `-1`

The ::markup-column property contains the number of the model column
containing markup information to be displayed. The markup column must be
of type `G_TYPE_STRING`. If this property and the :text-column property
are both set to column numbers, it overrides the text column.
If both are set to -1, no texts are displayed.

### `model`

`Gtk.TreeModel | ReactElement`

The model of the icon view.

### `pixbufColumn`

`number` · default `-1`

The ::pixbuf-column property contains the number of the model column
containing the pixbufs which are displayed. The pixbuf column must be
of type `GDK_TYPE_PIXBUF`. Setting this property to -1 turns off the
display of pixbufs.

### `reorderable`

`boolean` · default `false`

The reorderable property specifies if the items can be reordered
by DND.

### `rowSpacing`

`number` · default `6`

The row-spacing property specifies the space which is inserted between
the rows of the icon view.

### `selectionMode`

`Gtk.SelectionMode` · default `GTK_SELECTION_SINGLE`

The ::selection-mode property specifies the selection mode of
icon view. If the mode is `GTK_SELECTION_MULTIPLE`, rubberband selection
is enabled, for the other modes, only keyboard selection is possible.

### `spacing`

containing the texts which are displayed. The text column must be
of type `G_TYPE_STRING`. If this property and the :markup-column
property are both set to -1, no texts are displayed.

### `tooltipColumn`

`number` · default `-1`

The column of the icon view model which is being used for displaying
tooltips on it's rows.

### `vadjustment`

`Gtk.Adjustment | ReactElement` · from `GtkScrollable`

Vertical `GtkAdjustment` of the scrollable widget.

This adjustment is shared between the scrollable widget and its parent.

### `vscrollPolicy`

`Gtk.ScrollablePolicy` · default `GTK_SCROLL_MINIMUM` · from `GtkScrollable`

### `pathIsSelected`

```ts
pathIsSelected(path: Gtk.TreePath): boolean

Returns `true` if the icon pointed to by `path` is currently
selected. If `path` does not point to a valid location, `false` is returned.

**Parameters**

- `path`: A `GtkTreePath` to check selection on.

### `scrollToPath`

```ts
scrollToPath(path: Gtk.TreePath, useAlign: boolean, rowAlign: number, colAlign: number): void
```

Moves the alignments of `icon_view` to the position specified by `path`.
`row_align` determines where the row is placed, and `col_align` determines
where `column` is placed.  Both are expected to be between 0.0 and 1.0.
0.0 means left/top alignment, 1.0 means right/bottom alignment, 0.5 means
center.

If `use_align` is `false`, then the alignment arguments are ignored, and the
tree does the minimum amount of work to scroll the item onto the screen.
This means that the item will be scrolled to the edge closest to its current
position.  If the item is currently visible on the screen, nothing is done.

This function only works if the model is set, and `path` is a valid row on
the model. If the model changes before the `icon_view` is realized, the
centered path will be modified to reflect this change.

**Parameters**

- `path`: The path of the item to move to.
- `useAlign`: whether to use alignment arguments, or `false`.
- `rowAlign`: The vertical alignment of the item specified by `path`.
- `colAlign`: The horizontal alignment of the item specified by `path`.

```ts
setCursor(path: Gtk.TreePath, cell: Gtk.CellRenderer | null, startEditing: boolean): void
```

Sets the current keyboard focus to be at `path`, and selects it.  This is
useful when you want to focus the user’s attention on a particular item.
If `cell` is not `null`, then focus is given to the cell specified by
it. Additionally, if `start_editing` is `true`, then editing should be
started in the specified cell.

This function is often followed by `gtk_widget_grab_focus
(icon_view)` in order to give keyboard focus to the widget.
Please note that editing can only happen when the widget is realized.

**Parameters**

- `path`: A `GtkTreePath`

the text column set by `gtk_icon_view_set_text_column()`.

**Parameters**

- `column`: A column in the currently used model, or -1 to display no text

> **Deprecated since 4.10.** Use `Gtk.GridView` instead

### `setModel`

```ts
setModel(model: Gtk.TreeModel | null): void
```

Sets the model for a `GtkIconView`.
If the `icon_view` already has a model set, it will remove
it before setting the new model.  If `model` is `null`, then
it will unset the old model.

**Parameters**

- `model`: The model.

### `setPixbufColumn`

```ts
setPixbufColumn(column: number): void
```

Sets the column with pixbufs for `icon_view` to be `column`. The pixbuf
column must be of type `GDK_TYPE_PIXBUF`

**Parameters**

- `column`: A column in the currently used model, or -1 to disable

> **Deprecated since 4.10.** Use `Gtk.GridView` instead

### `setReorderable`

```ts
setReorderable(reorderable: boolean): void
```

This function is a convenience function to allow you to reorder models that
support the `GtkTreeDragSourceIface` and the `GtkTreeDragDestIface`. Both
`GtkTreeStore` and `GtkListStore` support these. If `reorderable` is `true`, then
the user can reorder the model by dragging and dropping rows.  The
developer can listen to these changes by connecting to the model's
row_inserted and row_deleted signals. The reordering is implemented by setting up
the icon view as a drag source and destination. Therefore, drag and
drop can not be used in a reorderable view for any other purpose.

This function does not give you any degree of control over the order -- any
reordering is allowed.  If more control is needed, you should probably
handle drag and drop manually.

**Parameters**

- `reorderable`: `true`, if the list of items can be reordered.

> **Deprecated since 4.10.** Use `Gtk.GridView` instead

### `setRowSpacing`

```ts
setRowSpacing(rowSpacing: number): void
```

Sets the ::row-spacing property which specifies the space
which is inserted between the rows of the icon view.

**Parameters**

- `rowSpacing`: the row spacing

> **Deprecated since 4.10.** Use `Gtk.GridView` instead

### `setSelectionMode`

```ts
setSelectionMode(mode: Gtk.SelectionMode): void
```

Sets the selection mode of the `icon_view`.

**Parameters**

- `mode`: The selection mode

> **Deprecated since 4.10.** Use `Gtk.GridView` instead

### `setSpacing`

```ts
setSpacing(spacing: number): void
```

Sets the ::spacing property which specifies the space
which is inserted between the cells (i.e. the icon and
the text) of an item.

**Parameters**

- `spacing`: the spacing

> **Deprecated since 4.10.** Use `Gtk.GridView` instead

### `setTextColumn`

```ts
setTextColumn(column: number): void
```

Sets the column with text for `icon_view` to be `column`. The text
column must be of type `G_TYPE_STRING`.

**Parameters**

- `column`: A column in the currently used model, or -1 to display no text

> **Deprecated since 4.10.** Use `Gtk.GridView` instead

### `setTooltipCell`

```ts
setTooltipCell(tooltip: Gtk.Tooltip, path: Gtk.TreePath, cell: Gtk.CellRenderer | null): void
```

Sets the tip area of `tooltip` to the area which `cell` occupies in
the item pointed to by `path`. See also `gtk_tooltip_set_tip_area()`.

See also `gtk_icon_view_set_tooltip_column()` for a simpler alternative.

**Parameters**

- `tooltip`: a `GtkTooltip`
- `path`: a `GtkTreePath`
- `cell`: a `GtkCellRenderer`

> **Deprecated since 4.10.** Use `Gtk.GridView` instead

### `setTooltipColumn`

```ts
setTooltipColumn(column: number): void
```

If you only plan to have simple (text-only) tooltips on full items, you
can use this function to have `GtkIconView` handle these automatically
for you. `column` should be set to the column in `icon_view`’s model
containing the tooltip texts, or -1 to disable this feature.

When enabled, `GtkWidget:has-tooltip` will be set to `true` and
`icon_view` will connect a `GtkWidget::query-tooltip` signal handler.

Note that the signal handler sets the text with `gtk_tooltip_set_markup()`,
so &, <, etc have to be escaped in the text.

**Parameters**

- `column`: an integer, which is a valid column number for `icon_view`’s model

> **Deprecated since 4.10.** Use `Gtk.GridView` instead

### `setTooltipItem`

```ts
setTooltipItem(tooltip: Gtk.Tooltip, path: Gtk.TreePath): void
```

Sets the tip area of `tooltip` to be the area covered by the item at `path`.
See also `gtk_icon_view_set_tooltip_column()` for a simpler alternative.
See also `gtk_tooltip_set_tip_area()`.

**Parameters**

- `tooltip`: a `GtkTooltip`
- `path`: a `GtkTreePath`

> **Deprecated since 4.10.** Use `Gtk.GridView` instead

### `unselectAll`

```ts
unselectAll(): void
```

Unselects all the icons.

> **Deprecated since 4.10.** Use `Gtk.GridView` instead

### `unselectPath`

```ts
unselectPath(path: Gtk.TreePath): void
```

Unselects the row at `path`.

**Parameters**

- `path`: The `GtkTreePath` to be unselected.

> **Deprecated since 4.10.** Use `Gtk.GridView` instead

### `unsetModelDragDest`

```ts
unsetModelDragDest(): void
```

Undoes the effect of `gtk_icon_view_enable_model_drag_dest()`. Calling this
method sets `GtkIconView`:reorderable to `false`.

> **Deprecated since 4.10.** Use `Gtk.GridView` instead

### `unsetModelDragSource`

```ts
unsetModelDragSource(): void
```

Undoes the effect of `gtk_icon_view_enable_model_drag_source()`. Calling this
method sets `GtkIconView`:reorderable to `false`.

> **Deprecated since 4.10.** Use `Gtk.GridView` instead

# GtkFileChooserNative

`GtkFileChooserNative` is an abstraction of a dialog suitable
for use with “File Open” or “File Save as” commands.

By default, this just uses a `GtkFileChooserDialog` to implement
the actual dialog. However, on some platforms, such as Windows and
macOS, the native platform file chooser is used instead. When the
application is running in a sandboxed environment without direct
filesystem access (such as Flatpak), `GtkFileChooserNative` may call
the proper APIs (portals) to let the user choose a file and make it
available to the application.

While the API of `GtkFileChooserNative` closely mirrors `GtkFileChooserDialog`,
the main difference is that there is no access to any `GtkWindow` or `GtkWidget`
for the dialog. This is required, as there may not be one in the case of a
platform native dialog.

Showing, hiding and running the dialog is handled by the
`Gtk.NativeDialog` functions.

Note that unlike `GtkFileChooserDialog`, `GtkFileChooserNative` objects
are not toplevel widgets, and GTK does not keep them alive. It is your
responsibility to keep a reference until you are done with the
object.

### Typical usage

In the simplest of cases, you can the following code to use
`GtkFileChooserNative` to select a file for opening:

```c
static void
on_response (GtkNativeDialog *native,
             int              response)
{
  if (response == GTK_RESPONSE_ACCEPT)
    {
      GtkFileChooser *chooser = GTK_FILE_CHOOSER (native);
      GFile *file = gtk_file_chooser_get_file (chooser);

      open_file (file);

      g_object_unref (file);
    }

  g_object_unref (native);
}

  // ...
  GtkFileChooserNative *native;
  GtkFileChooserAction action = GTK_FILE_CHOOSER_ACTION_OPEN;

  native = gtk_file_chooser_native_new ("Open File",
                                        parent_window,
                                        action,
                                        "_Open",
                                        "_Cancel");

  g_signal_connect (native, "response", G_CALLBACK (on_response), NULL);
  gtk_native_dialog_show (GTK_NATIVE_DIALOG (native));
```

To use a `GtkFileChooserNative` for saving, you can use this:

```c
static void
on_response (GtkNativeDialog *native,
             int              response)
{
  if (response == GTK_RESPONSE_ACCEPT)
    {
      GtkFileChooser *chooser = GTK_FILE_CHOOSER (native);
      GFile *file = gtk_file_chooser_get_file (chooser);

      save_to_file (file);

      g_object_unref (file);
    }

  g_object_unref (native);
}

  // ...
  GtkFileChooserNative *native;
  GtkFileChooser *chooser;
  GtkFileChooserAction action = GTK_FILE_CHOOSER_ACTION_SAVE;

  native = gtk_file_chooser_native_new ("Save File",
                                        parent_window,
                                        action,
                                        "_Save",
                                        "_Cancel");
  chooser = GTK_FILE_CHOOSER (native);

  if (user_edited_a_new_document)
    gtk_file_chooser_set_current_name (chooser, _("Untitled document"));
  else
    gtk_file_chooser_set_file (chooser, existing_file, NULL);

  g_signal_connect (native, "response", G_CALLBACK (on_response), NULL);
  gtk_native_dialog_show (GTK_NATIVE_DIALOG (native));
```

see the `Gtk.FileChooserDialog` documentation.

### Response Codes

`GtkFileChooserNative` inherits from `Gtk.NativeDialog`,
which means it will return `GTK_RESPONSE_ACCEPT` if the user accepted,
and `GTK_RESPONSE_CANCEL` if he pressed cancel. It can also return
`GTK_RESPONSE_DELETE_EVENT` if the window was unexpectedly closed.

### Differences from `GtkFileChooserDialog`

There are a few things in the `Gtk.FileChooser` interface that
are not possible to use with `GtkFileChooserNative`, as such use would
prohibit the use of a native dialog.

No operations that change the dialog work while the dialog is visible.
Set all the properties that are required before showing the dialog.

### Win32 details

On windows the `IFileDialog` implementation (added in Windows Vista) is
used. It supports many of the features that `GtkFileChooser` has, but
there are some things it does not handle:

* Any `Gtk.FileFilter` added using a mimetype

If any of these features are used the regular `GtkFileChooserDialog`
will be used in place of the native one.

### Portal details

When the `org.freedesktop.portal.FileChooser` portal is available on
the session bus, it is used to bring up an out-of-process file chooser.
Depending on the kind of session the application is running in, this may
or may not be a GTK file chooser.

### macOS details

On macOS the `NSSavePanel` and `NSOpenPanel` classes are used to provide
native file chooser dialogs. Some features provided by `GtkFileChooser`
are not supported:

* Shortcut folders.

## Hierarchy

[GObject](.gtkx/reference/gobject/object.md) → [GtkNativeDialog](.gtkx/reference/gtk/native-dialog.md) → **GtkFileChooserNative**

Implements `GtkFileChooser`.

## Props

`ref` receives the `Gtk.FileChooserNative` instance. Every mutable property also has an `onNotify<Prop>` handler prop called with the new value when the property changes. Props inherited from ancestor elements are documented on their own pages.

### `acceptLabel`

`string` · default `null`

The text used for the label on the accept button in the dialog, or
`null` to use the default text.

### `action`

`Gtk.FileChooserAction` · default `GTK_FILE_CHOOSER_ACTION_OPEN` · deprecated since 4.10 · from `GtkFileChooser`

The type of operation that the file chooser is performing.

> **Deprecated since 4.10.** Use `Gtk.FileDialog` instead

### `cancelLabel`

`string` · default `null`

The text used for the label on the cancel button in the dialog, or
`null` to use the default text.

### `createFolders`

`boolean` · default `true` · deprecated since 4.10 · from `GtkFileChooser`

Whether a file chooser not in `GTK_FILE_CHOOSER_ACTION_OPEN` mode
will offer the user to create new folders.

> **Deprecated since 4.10.** Use `Gtk.FileDialog` instead

### `filter`

`Gtk.FileFilter | ReactElement` · deprecated since 4.10 · from `GtkFileChooser`

The current filter for selecting files that are displayed.

> **Deprecated since 4.10.** Use `Gtk.FileDialog` instead

### `filters`

`Gio.ListModel` · read-only, observe with `onNotifyFilters` · deprecated since 4.10 · from `GtkFileChooser`

A `GListModel` containing the filters that have been
added with `gtk_file_chooser_add_filter()`.

The returned object should not be modified. It may
or may not be updated for later changes.

> **Deprecated since 4.10.** Use `Gtk.FileDialog` instead

### `selectMultiple`

`boolean` · default `false` · deprecated since 4.10 · from `GtkFileChooser`

Whether to allow multiple files to be selected.

> **Deprecated since 4.10.** Use `Gtk.FileDialog` instead

### `shortcutFolders`

`Gio.ListModel` · read-only, observe with `onNotifyShortcutFolders` · deprecated since 4.10 · from `GtkFileChooser`

A `GListModel` containing the shortcut folders that have been
added with `gtk_file_chooser_add_shortcut_folder()`.

The returned object should not be modified. It may
or may not be updated for later changes.

> **Deprecated since 4.10.** Use `Gtk.FileDialog` instead

## Methods

Methods are called on the `Gtk.FileChooserNative` instance, obtained with the `ref` prop or imported from `@gtkx/gi/gtk`. Methods inherited from ancestors are documented on their own pages.

### `getAcceptLabel`

```ts
getAcceptLabel(): string | null
```

Retrieves the custom label text for the accept button.

**Returns** The custom label

> **Deprecated since 4.10.** Use `Gtk.FileDialog` instead

### `getCancelLabel`

```ts
getCancelLabel(): string | null
```

Retrieves the custom label text for the cancel button.

**Returns** The custom label

> **Deprecated since 4.10.** Use `Gtk.FileDialog` instead

### `setAcceptLabel`

```ts
setAcceptLabel(acceptLabel: string | null): void
```

Sets the custom label text for the accept button.

If characters in `label` are preceded by an underscore, they are
underlined. If you need a literal underscore character in a label,
use “__” (two underscores). The first underlined character represents
a keyboard accelerator called a mnemonic.

Pressing Alt and that key should activate the button.

**Parameters**

- `acceptLabel`: custom label

> **Deprecated since 4.10.** Use `Gtk.FileDialog` instead

### `setCancelLabel`

```ts
setCancelLabel(cancelLabel: string | null): void
```

Sets the custom label text for the cancel button.

If characters in `label` are preceded by an underscore, they are
underlined. If you need a literal underscore character in a label,
use “__” (two underscores). The first underlined character represents
a keyboard accelerator called a mnemonic.

Pressing Alt and that key should activate the button.

**Parameters**

- `cancelLabel`: custom label

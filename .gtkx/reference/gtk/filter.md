# GtkFilter

Describes the filtering to be performed by a `Gtk.FilterListModel`.

The model will use the filter to determine if it should include items
or not by calling `Gtk.Filter.match()` for each item and only
keeping the ones that the function returns true for.

Filters may change what items they match through their lifetime. In that
case, they will emit the `Gtk.Filter.changed` signal to notify
that previous filter results are no longer valid and that items should
be checked again via `Gtk.Filter.match()`.

GTK provides various pre-made filter implementations for common filtering
operations. These filters often include properties that can be linked to
various widgets to easily allow searches.

However, in particular for large lists or complex search methods, it is
also possible to subclass `GtkFilter` and provide one's own filter.

```tsx
import { GtkFilter } from "@gtkx/jsx/gtk";
```

## Hierarchy

[GObject](.gtkx/reference/gobject/object.md) → **GtkFilter**

## Props

`ref` receives the `Gtk.Filter` instance. Every mutable property also has an `onNotify<Prop>` handler prop called with the new value when the property changes. Props inherited from ancestor elements are documented on their own pages.

## Signals

### `onChanged`

```ts
(change: Gtk.FilterChange, self: Gtk.Filter) => void
```

Emitted whenever the filter changed.

Users of the filter should then check items again via
`Gtk.Filter.match()`.

`GtkFilterListModel` handles this signal automatically.

Depending on the `change` parameter, not all items need
to be checked, but only some. Refer to the `Gtk.FilterChange`
documentation for details.

**Parameters**

- `change`: how the filter changed
- `self`: The instance the signal was emitted on.

## Methods

Methods are called on the `Gtk.Filter` instance, obtained with the `ref` prop or imported from `@gtkx/gi/gtk`. Methods inherited from ancestors are documented on their own pages.

### `changed`

```ts
changed(change: Gtk.FilterChange): void
```

Notifies all users of the filter that it has changed.

This emits the `Gtk.Filter.changed` signal. Users
of the filter should then check items again via
`Gtk.Filter.match()`.

Depending on the `change` parameter, not all items need to
be changed, but only some. Refer to the `Gtk.FilterChange`
documentation for details.

This function is intended for implementers of `GtkFilter`
subclasses and should not be called from other functions.

**Parameters**

- `change`: how the filter changed

### `getStrictness`

```ts
getStrictness(): Gtk.FilterMatch
```

Gets the known strictness of a filter.

If the strictness is not known, `Gtk.FilterMatch.some` is returned.

This value may change after emission of the `Gtk.Filter.changed`
signal.

This function is meant purely for optimization purposes. Filters can
choose to omit implementing it, but `GtkFilterListModel` uses it.

**Returns** the strictness of `self`

### `match`

```ts
match(item: GObject.Object): boolean
```

Checks if the given `item` is matched by the filter or not.

**Parameters**

- `item`: The item to check

**Returns** true if the filter matches the item

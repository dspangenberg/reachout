# GtkSizeGroup

Groups widgets together so they all request the same size.

This is typically useful when you want a column of widgets to have
the same size, but you can’t use a `Gtk.Grid` or `Gtk.Box`.

In detail, the size requested for each widget in a `GtkSizeGroup` is
the maximum of the sizes that would have been requested for each
widget in the size group if they were not in the size group. The
[mode]`Gtk.SizeGroup.setMode()` of the size group determines
whether this applies to the horizontal size, the vertical size, or
both sizes.

Note that size groups only affect the amount of space requested, not
the size that the widgets finally receive. If you want the widgets in
a `GtkSizeGroup` to actually be the same size, you need to pack them in
such a way that they get the size they request and not more. In
particular it doesn't make a lot of sense to set
[the expand flags]`Gtk.Widget.setHexpand()` on the widgets that
are members of a size group.

 If the widgets in the size group are
subsequently destroyed, then they will be removed from the size group
and drop their references on the size group; when all widgets have been
removed, the size group will be freed.

Widgets can be part of multiple size groups; GTK will compute the
horizontal size of a widget from the horizontal requisition of all widgets
that can be reached from the widget by a chain of size groups with mode
`Gtk.SizeGroupMode.HORIZONTAL` or `Gtk.SizeGroupMode.BOTH`, and
the vertical size from the vertical requisition of all widgets that can be
reached from the widget by a chain of size groups with mode
`Gtk.SizeGroupMode.VERTICAL` or `Gtk.SizeGroupMode.BOTH`.

## Size groups and trading height-for-width

::: warning
    Generally, size groups don't interact well with widgets that
    trade height for width (or width for height), such as wrappable
    labels. Avoid using size groups with such widgets.

A size group with mode `Gtk.SizeGroupMode.HORIZONTAL` or
`Gtk.SizeGroupMode.VERTICAL` only consults non-contextual sizes
of widgets other than the one being measured, since it has no
knowledge of what size a widget will get allocated in the other
orientation. This can lead to widgets in a group actually requesting
different contextual sizes, contrary to the purpose of
`GtkSizeGroup`.

In contrast, a size group with mode `Gtk.SizeGroupMode.BOTH` can
properly propagate the available size in the opposite orientation
when measuring widgets in the group, which results in consistent and
accurate measurements.

In case some mechanism other than a size group is already used to
ensure that widgets in a group all get the same size in one
orientation (for example, some common ancestor is known to allocate
the same width to all its children), and the size group is only
really needed to also make the widgets request the same size in the
other orientation, it is beneficial to still set the group's mode to
`Gtk.SizeGroupMode.BOTH`. This lets the group assume and count
on sizes of the widgets in the former orientation being the same,
which enables it to propagate the available size as described above.

## Alternatives to size groups

Size groups have many limitations, such as only influencing size
requests but not allocations, and poor height-for-width support. When
possible, prefer using dedicated mechanisms that can properly ensure
that the widgets get the same size.

Various container widgets and layout managers support a homogeneous
layout mode, where they will explicitly give the same size to their
children (see `Gtk.Box.homogeneous`). Using homogeneous mode
can also have large performance benefits compared to either the same
container in non-homogeneous mode, or to size groups.

`Gtk.Grid` can be used to position widgets into rows and
columns. Members of each column will have the same width among them;
likewise, members of each row will have the same height. On top of
that, the heights can be made equal between all rows with
`Gtk.Grid.rowHomogeneous`, and the widths can be made equal
between all columns with `Gtk.Grid.columnHomogeneous`.

## GtkSizeGroup as GtkBuildable

Size groups can be specified in a UI definition by placing an `<object>`
element with `class="GtkSizeGroup"` somewhere in the UI definition. The
widgets that belong to the size group are specified by a `<widgets>` element
that may contain multiple `<widget>` elements, one for each member of the
size group. The ”name” attribute gives the id of the widget.

An example of a UI definition fragment with `GtkSizeGroup`:
```xml
<object class="GtkSizeGroup">
  <property name="mode">horizontal</property>
  <widgets>
    <widget name="radio1"/>
    <widget name="radio2"/>
  </widgets>
</object>
```

```tsx
import { GtkSizeGroup } from "@gtkx/jsx/gtk";
```

## Hierarchy

[GObject](.gtkx/reference/gobject/object.md) → **GtkSizeGroup**

Implements `GtkBuildable`.

## Static methods

Static methods are called on `Gtk.SizeGroup`, imported from `@gtkx/gi/gtk`.

### `new`

```ts
new(mode: Gtk.SizeGroupMode): Gtk.SizeGroup
```

Create a new `GtkSizeGroup`.

**Parameters**

- `mode`: the mode for the new size group.

**Returns** a newly created `GtkSizeGroup`

## Props

`ref` receives the `Gtk.SizeGroup` instance. Every mutable property also has an `onNotify<Prop>` handler prop called with the new value when the property changes. Props inherited from ancestor elements are documented on their own pages.

### `mode`

`Gtk.SizeGroupMode` · default `GTK_SIZE_GROUP_HORIZONTAL`

The direction in which the size group affects requested sizes.

### `widgets`

`Gtk.Widget[] | null`

Widgets the group keeps at a common size.

## Methods

Methods are called on the `Gtk.SizeGroup` instance, obtained with the `ref` prop or imported from `@gtkx/gi/gtk`. Methods inherited from ancestors are documented on their own pages.

### `addWidget`

```ts
addWidget(widget: Gtk.Widget): void
```

Adds a widget to a `GtkSizeGroup`.

In the future, the requisition
of the widget will be determined as the maximum of its requisition
and the requisition of the other widgets in the size group.
Whether this applies horizontally, vertically, or in both directions
depends on the mode of the size group.
See `Gtk.SizeGroup.setMode()`.

When the widget is destroyed or no longer referenced elsewhere, it
will be removed from the size group.

**Parameters**

- `widget`: the `GtkWidget` to add

### `getMode`

```ts
getMode(): Gtk.SizeGroupMode
```

Gets the current mode of the size group.

**Returns** the current mode of the size group.

### `getWidgets`

```ts
getWidgets(): Gtk.Widget[]
```

Returns the list of widgets associated with `size_group`.

**Returns** a `GSList` of
  widgets. The list is owned by GTK and should not be modified.

### `removeWidget`

```ts
removeWidget(widget: Gtk.Widget): void
```

Removes a widget from a `GtkSizeGroup`.

**Parameters**

- `widget`: the `GtkWidget` to remove

### `setMode`

```ts
setMode(mode: Gtk.SizeGroupMode): void
```

Sets the `GtkSizeGroupMode` of the size group.

The mode of the size group determines whether the widgets in the
size group should all have the same horizontal requisition
(`GTK_SIZE_GROUP_HORIZONTAL`) all have the same vertical requisition
(`GTK_SIZE_GROUP_VERTICAL`), or should all have the same requisition
in both directions (`GTK_SIZE_GROUP_BOTH`).

**Parameters**

- `mode`: the mode to set for the size group.

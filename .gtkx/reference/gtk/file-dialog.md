# GtkFileDialog

Asynchronous API to present a file chooser dialog.

`GtkFileDialog` collects the arguments that are needed to present
the dialog to the user, such as a title for the dialog and whether
it should be modal.

The dialog is shown with `Gtk.FileDialog.open()`,
`Gtk.FileDialog.save()`, etc.

_Available since 4.10._

```tsx
import { GtkFileDialog } from "@gtkx/jsx/gtk";
```

## Hierarchy

[GObject](.gtkx/reference/gobject/object.md) → **GtkFileDialog**

## Static methods

Static methods are called on `Gtk.FileDialog`, imported from `@gtkx/gi/gtk`.

### `new`

```ts
new(): Gtk.FileDialog
```

Creates a new `GtkFileDialog` object.

**Returns** the new `GtkFileDialog`

_Available since 4.10._

## Props

`ref` receives the `Gtk.FileDialog` instance. Every mutable property also has an `onNotify<Prop>` handler prop called with the new value when the property changes. Props inherited from ancestor elements are documented on their own pages.

### `acceptLabel`

`string` · default `null`

Label for the file chooser's accept button.

_Available since 4.10._

### `defaultFilter`

`Gtk.FileFilter | ReactElement`

The default filter.

This filter is initially active in the file chooser dialog.

If the default filter is `NULL`, the first filter of `Gtk.FileDialog.filters`
is used as the default filter. If that property contains no filter, the dialog will
be unfiltered.

If `Gtk.FileDialog.filters` is not `NULL`, the default filter should be
part of the list. If it is not, the dialog may choose to not make it available.

_Available since 4.10._

### `filters`

`Gio.ListModel | ReactElement`

The list of filters.

See `Gtk.FileDialog.defaultFilter` about how these
two properties interact.

_Available since 4.10._

### `initialFile`

`Gio.File | ReactElement`

The initial file.

This file is initially selected in the file chooser dialog

This is a utility property that sets both `Gtk.FileDialog.initialFolder`
and `Gtk.FileDialog.initialName`.

_Available since 4.10._

### `initialFolder`

`Gio.File | ReactElement`

The initial folder.

This is the directory that is initially opened in the file chooser dialog.

_Available since 4.10._

### `initialName`

`string` · default `null`

The initial name.

This is the name of the file that is initially selected in the file chooser dialog.

_Available since 4.10._

### `modal`

`boolean` · default `true`

Whether the file chooser dialog is modal.

_Available since 4.10._

### `title`

`string` · default `null`

A title that may be shown on the file chooser dialog.

_Available since 4.10._

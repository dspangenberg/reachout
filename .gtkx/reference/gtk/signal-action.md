# GtkSignalAction

Emits a signal on a widget.

Signals that are used in this way are referred to as keybinding signals,
and they are expected to be defined with the `G_SIGNAL_ACTION` flag.

```tsx
import { GtkSignalAction } from "@gtkx/jsx/gtk";
```

## Hierarchy

[GObject](.gtkx/reference/gobject/object.md) → [GtkShortcutAction](.gtkx/reference/gtk/shortcut-action.md) → **GtkSignalAction**

## Static methods

Static methods are called on `Gtk.SignalAction`, imported from `@gtkx/gi/gtk`.

### `new`

```ts
new(signalName: string): Gtk.SignalAction
```

Creates an action that when activated, emits the given action signal
on the provided widget.

It will also unpack the args into arguments passed to the signal.

**Parameters**

- `signalName`: name of the signal to emit

**Returns** a new `GtkShortcutAction`

## Props

`ref` receives the `Gtk.SignalAction` instance. Every mutable property also has an `onNotify<Prop>` handler prop called with the new value when the property changes. Props inherited from ancestor elements are documented on their own pages.

### `signalName`

`string` · default `null` · construct-only

The name of the signal to emit.

## Methods

Methods are called on the `Gtk.SignalAction` instance, obtained with the `ref` prop or imported from `@gtkx/gi/gtk`. Methods inherited from ancestors are documented on their own pages.

### `getSignalName`

```ts
getSignalName(): string
```

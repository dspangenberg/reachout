# GdkDmabufTextureBuilder

Constructs `Gdk.Texture` objects from DMA buffers.

DMA buffers are commonly called **_dma-bufs_**.

DMA buffers are a feature of the Linux kernel to enable efficient buffer and
memory sharing between hardware such as codecs, GPUs, displays, cameras and the
kernel drivers controlling them. For example, a decoder may want its output to
be directly shared with the display server for rendering without a copy.

Any device driver which participates in DMA buffer sharing, can do so as either
the exporter or importer of buffers (or both).

The memory that is shared via DMA buffers is usually stored in non-system memory
(maybe in device's local memory or something else not directly accessible by the
CPU), and accessing this memory from the CPU may have higher-than-usual overhead.

In particular for graphics data, it is not uncommon that data consists of multiple
separate blocks of memory, for example one block for each of the red, green and
blue channels. These blocks are called **_planes_**. DMA buffers can have up to
four planes. Even if the memory is a single block, the data can be organized in
multiple planes, by specifying offsets from the beginning of the data.

DMA buffers are exposed to user-space as file descriptors allowing to pass them
between processes. If a DMA buffer has multiple planes, more than one file
descriptor may be present, up to the number of planes. If the number of file
descriptors is less than the number of planes, the remaining ones should be set to
-1.

The format of the data (for graphics data, essentially its colorspace) is described
by a 32-bit integer. These format identifiers are defined in the header file `drm_fourcc.h`
and commonly referred to as **_fourcc_** values, since they are identified by 4 ASCII
characters. Additionally, each DMA buffer has a **_modifier_**, which is a 64-bit integer
that describes driver-specific details of the memory layout, such as tiling or compression.

For historical reasons, some producers of dma-bufs don't provide an explicit modifier, but
instead return `DMA_FORMAT_MOD_INVALID` to indicate that their modifier is **_implicit_**.
GTK tries to accommodate this situation by accepting `DMA_FORMAT_MOD_INVALID` as modifier.

The operation of `GdkDmabufTextureBuilder` is quite simple: Create a texture builder,
set all the necessary properties, and then call `Gdk.DmabufTextureBuilder.build()`
to create the new texture.

The required properties for a dma-buf texture are

 * The width and height in pixels

 * The `fourcc` code and `modifier` which identify the format and memory layout of the dma-buf

 * The file descriptor, offset and stride for each of the planes

`GdkDmabufTextureBuilder` can be used for quick one-shot construction of
textures as well as kept around and reused to construct multiple textures.

## Methods

Methods are called on the `Gdk.DmabufTextureBuilder` instance, obtained with the `ref` prop or imported from `@gtkx/gi/gdk`. Methods inherited from ancestors are documented on their own pages.

### `build`

```ts
build(destroy: GLib.DestroyNotify | null, data: bigint | null): Gdk.Texture | null
```

Builds a new `GdkTexture` with the values set up in the builder.

It is a programming error to call this function if any mandatory property has not been set.

Not all formats defined in the `drm_fourcc.h` header are supported. You can use
`Gdk.Display.getDmabufFormats()` to get a list of supported formats. If the
format is not supported by GTK, `null` will be returned and `error` will be set.

The `destroy` function gets called when the returned texture gets released.

It is the responsibility of the caller to keep the file descriptors for the planes
open until the created texture is no longer used, and close them afterwards (possibly
using the `destroy` notify).

It is possible to call this function multiple times to create multiple textures,
possibly with changing properties in between.

**Parameters**

- `destroy`: destroy function to be called when the texture is released
- `data`: user data to pass to the destroy function

**Returns** a newly built `GdkTexture` or `NULL`
  if the format is not supported

**Throws** A `GLib.Error` carrying the failing operation's domain, code, and message.

correct colorstate based on the format.
If you don't know what colorstates are, this is probably the right thing.

### `setFourcc`

```ts
setFourcc(fourcc: number): void

setStride(plane: number, stride: number): void
```

Sets the stride for a plane.

The stride must be set for all planes before calling `Gdk.DmabufTextureBuilder.build()`.

**Parameters**

- `plane`: the plane to set the stride for
- `stride`: the stride value

_Available since 4.14._

### `setUpdateRegion`

```ts
setUpdateRegion(region: cairo.Region | null): void
```

Sets the region to be updated by this texture. Together with
`Gdk.DmabufTextureBuilder.updateTexture` this describes an
update of a previous texture.

When rendering animations of large textures, it is possible that
consecutive textures are only updating contents in parts of the texture.
It is then possible to describe this update via these two properties,
so that GTK can avoid rerendering parts that did not change.

An example would be a screen recording where only the mouse pointer moves.

**Parameters**

- `region`: the region to update

_Available since 4.14._

### `setUpdateTexture`

```ts
setUpdateTexture(texture: Gdk.Texture | null): void
```

Sets the texture to be updated by this texture. See
`Gdk.DmabufTextureBuilder.setUpdateRegion()` for an explanation.

**Parameters**

- `texture`: the texture to update

_Available since 4.14._

### `setWidth`

```ts
setWidth(width: number): void
```

Sets the width of the texture.

The width must be set before calling `Gdk.DmabufTextureBuilder.build()`.

**Parameters**

- `width`: The texture's width or 0 to unset

_Available since 4.14._

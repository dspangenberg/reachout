# AdwBin

A widget with one child.

The `AdwBin` widget has only one child, set with the `Bin.child`
property.

It is useful for deriving subclasses, since it provides common code needed
for handling a single child widget.

```tsx
import { AdwBin } from "@gtkx/jsx/adw";
```

## Hierarchy

[GObject](.gtkx/reference/gobject/object.md) → [GInitiallyUnowned](.gtkx/reference/gobject/initially-unowned.md) → [GtkWidget](.gtkx/reference/gtk/widget.md) → **AdwBin**

Implements `GtkAccessible`, `GtkBuildable`, `GtkConstraintTarget`.

## Static methods

Static methods are called on `Adw.Bin`, imported from `@gtkx/gi/adw`.

### `new`

```ts
new(): Gtk.Widget
```

Creates a new `AdwBin`.

**Returns** the new created `AdwBin`

## Props

`ref` receives the `Adw.Bin` instance. Every mutable property also has an `onNotify<Prop>` handler prop called with the new value when the property changes. Props inherited from ancestor elements are documented on their own pages.

### `children`

`ReactNode`

Elements attached to the element's default child slot, or its text for elements that hold text.

## Methods

Methods are called on the `Adw.Bin` instance, obtained with the `ref` prop or imported from `@gtkx/gi/adw`. Methods inherited from ancestors are documented on their own pages.

### `getChild`

```ts
getChild(): Gtk.Widget | null
```

Gets the child widget of `self`.

**Returns** the child widget of `self`

### `setChild`

```ts
setChild(child: Gtk.Widget | null): void
```

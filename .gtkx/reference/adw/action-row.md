# AdwActionRow

A `Gtk.ListBoxRow` used to present actions.

The `AdwActionRow` widget can have a title, a subtitle and an icon. The row
can receive additional widgets at its end, or prefix widgets at its start.

It is convenient to present a preference and its related actions.

`AdwActionRow` is unactivatable by default, giving it an activatable widget
will automatically make it activatable, but unsetting it won't change the
row's activatability.

### AdwActionRow as GtkBuildable

The `AdwActionRow` implementation of the `Gtk.Buildable` interface
supports adding a child at its end by specifying “suffix” or omitting the
“type” attribute of a <child> element.

It also supports adding a child as a prefix widget by specifying “prefix” as
the “type” attribute of a <child> element.

### CSS nodes

`AdwActionRow` has a main CSS node with name `row`.

It contains the subnode `box.header` for its main horizontal box, and
`box.title` for the vertical box containing the title and subtitle labels.

It contains subnodes `label.title` and `label.subtitle` representing
respectively the title label and subtitle label.

### Style classes

`AdwActionRow` can use the [`.property`](style-classes.html#property-rows)
style class to emphasize the row subtitle instead of the row title, which is
useful for displaying read-only properties.

When used together with the `.monospace` style class, only the subtitle
becomes monospace, not the title or any extra widgets.

```tsx
import { AdwActionRow } from "@gtkx/jsx/adw";
```

### `new`

```ts
new(): Gtk.Widget
```

Creates a new `AdwActionRow`.

**Returns** the newly created `AdwActionRow`

## Props

`ref` receives the `Adw.ActionRow` instance. Every mutable property also has an `onNotify<Prop>` handler prop called with the new value when the property changes. Props inherited from ancestor elements are documented on their own pages.

### `activatableWidget`

`Gtk.Widget | ReactElement`

The widget to activate when the row is activated.

The row can be activated either by clicking on it, calling
`ActionRow.activate()`, or via mnemonics in the title.

The target widget will be activated by emitting the
`Gtk.Widget.mnemonic-activate` signal on it.

### `iconName`

`string` · deprecated since 1.3

ellipsized.

If the value is 0, the number of lines won't be limited.

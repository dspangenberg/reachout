# AdwViewStack

A view container for `ViewSwitcher`.

`AdwViewStack` is a container which only shows one page at a time.
It is typically used to hold an application's main views.

It doesn't provide a way to transition between pages.
Instead, a separate widget such as `ViewSwitcher`,
`InlineViewSwitcher` or `ViewSwitcherSidebar` can be used with
`AdwViewStack` to provide this functionality.

`AdwViewStack` pages can have a title, an icon, an attention request, and a
numbered badge that `ViewSwitcher` will use to let users identify which
page is which. Set them using the `ViewStackPage.title`,
`ViewStackPage.iconName`,
`ViewStackPage.needsAttention`, and
`ViewStackPage.badgeNumber` properties.

`AdwViewStack` pages can also be grouped into sections, using the
`ViewStackPage.startsSection` and
`ViewStackPage.sectionTitle` properties. Currently, only
`ViewSwitcherSidebar` displays groups.

Unlike `Gtk.Stack`, transitions between views can only be animated via
a crossfade and size changes are always interpolated. Animations are disabled
by default. Use `ViewStack.enableTransitions` to enable them.

`AdwViewStack` maintains a `ViewStackPage` object for each added child,
which holds additional per-child properties. You obtain the
`ViewStackPage` for a child with `ViewStack.getPage()` and you
can obtain a `Gtk.SelectionModel` containing all the pages with
`ViewStack.getPages()`.

### AdwViewStack as GtkBuildable

To set child-specific properties in a .ui file, create
`ViewStackPage` objects explicitly, and set the child widget as a
property on it:

```xml
  <object class="AdwViewStack" id="stack">
    <child>
      <object class="AdwViewStackPage">
        <property name="name">overview</property>
        <property name="title">Overview</property>
        <property name="child">
          <object class="AdwStatusPage">
            <property name="title">Welcome!</property>
          </object>
        </property>
      </object>
    </child>
  </object>
```

### CSS nodes

`AdwViewStack` has a single CSS node named `stack`.

### Accessibility

`AdwViewStack` uses the `Gtk.AccessibleRole.tab-panel` for the stack
pages which are the accessible parent objects of the child widgets.

```tsx
import { AdwViewStack } from "@gtkx/jsx/adw";
```

## Hierarchy

[GObject](.gtkx/reference/gobject/object.md) → [GInitiallyUnowned](.gtkx/reference/gobject/initially-unowned.md) → [GtkWidget](.gtkx/reference/gtk/widget.md) → **AdwViewStack**

Implements `GtkAccessible`, `GtkBuildable`, `GtkConstraintTarget`.

## Static methods

Static methods are called on `Adw.ViewStack`, imported from `@gtkx/gi/adw`.

### `new`

```ts
new(): Gtk.Widget
```

Creates a new `AdwViewStack`.

**Returns** the newly created `AdwViewStack`

## Props

`ref` receives the `Adw.ViewStack` instance. Every mutable property also has an `onNotify<Prop>` handler prop called with the new value when the property changes. Props inherited from ancestor elements are documented on their own pages.

### `children`

`ReactNode`

Elements attached to the element's default child slot, or its text for elements that hold text.

### `enableTransitions`

`boolean` · default `false`

Whether the stack uses a crossfade transition between pages.

Use `ViewStack.transitionDuration` to control the duration, and
`ViewStack.transitionRunning` to know when the transition is
running.

_Available since 1.7._

### `hhomogeneous`

`boolean` · default `true`

Whether the stack is horizontally homogeneous.

If the stack is horizontally homogeneous, it allocates the same width for
all children.

If it's `FALSE`, the stack may change width when a different child becomes
visible.

### `pages`

`Gtk.SelectionModel` · read-only, observe with `onNotifyPages`

A selection model with the stack's pages.

This can be used to keep an up-to-date view.

The model implements `Gtk.SectionModel` and creates sections based on
`ViewStackPage.startsSection` values.

The model also implements `Gtk.SelectionModel` and can be used to
track and change the visible page.

### `transitionDuration`

`number` · default `200`

The transition animation duration, in milliseconds.

Only used when `ViewStack.enableTransitions` is set to `TRUE`.

_Available since 1.7._

### `transitionRunning`

`boolean` · default `false` · read-only, observe with `onNotifyTransitionRunning`

Whether a transition is currently running.

If a transition is impossible, the property value will be set to `TRUE` and
then immediately to `FALSE`, so it's possible to rely on its notifications
to know that a transition has happened.

_Available since 1.7._

### `vhomogeneous`

`boolean` · default `true`

Whether the stack is vertically homogeneous.

If the stack is vertically homogeneous, it allocates the same height for
all children.

If it's `FALSE`, the stack may change height when a different child becomes
visible.

### `visibleChild`

`Gtk.Widget | ReactElement`

The widget currently visible in the stack.

### `visibleChildName`

`string` · default `null`

The name of the widget currently visible in the stack.

See `ViewStack.visibleChild`.

## Methods

Methods are called on the `Adw.ViewStack` instance, obtained with the `ref` prop or imported from `@gtkx/gi/adw`. Methods inherited from ancestors are documented on their own pages.

# AdwWrapLayout

A box-like layout that can wrap into multiple lines.

`AdwWrapLayout` is similar to `Gtk.BoxLayout`, but can wrap lines when
the widgets cannot fit otherwise. Unlike `Gtk.FlowBox`, the children
aren't arranged into a grid and behave more like words in a wrapping label.

Like `GtkBoxLayout`, `AdwWrapLayout` is orientable and has spacing:

- `WrapLayout.childSpacing` between children in the same line;
- `WrapLayout.lineSpacing` between lines.

::: note
    Unlike `GtkBoxLayout`, `AdwWrapLayout` cannot follow the CSS
    `border-spacing` property.

Use the `WrapLayout.naturalLineLength` property to determine the
layout's natural size, e.g. when using it in a `Gtk.Popover`.

Normally, a horizontal `AdwWrapLayout` wraps left to right and top to bottom
for left-to-right languages. Both of these directions can be reversed, using
the `WrapLayout.packDirection` and
`WrapLayout.wrapReverse` properties. Additionally, the alignment
of each line can be controlled with the `WrapLayout.align` property.

Lines can be justified using the `WrapLayout.justify` property,
filling the entire line by either increasing child size or spacing depending
on the value. Set `WrapLayout.justifyLastLine` to justify the last
line as well.

By default, `AdwWrapLayout` wraps as soon as the previous line cannot fit
any more children without shrinking them past their natural size. Set
`WrapLayout.wrapPolicy` to `Adw.WrapPolicy.minimum` to only
wrap once all the children in the previous line have been shrunk to their
minimum size.

To make each line take the same amount of space, set
`WrapLayout.lineHomogeneous` to `TRUE`.

Spacing and natural line length can scale with the text scale factor, use the
`WrapLayout.childSpacingUnit`,
`WrapLayout.lineSpacingUnit` and/or
`WrapLayout.naturalLineLengthUnit` properties to enable that
behavior.

See `WrapBox`.

_Available since 1.7._

```tsx
import { AdwWrapLayout } from "@gtkx/jsx/adw";
```

## Hierarchy

[GObject](.gtkx/reference/gobject/object.md) → [GtkLayoutManager](.gtkx/reference/gtk/layout-manager.md) → **AdwWrapLayout**

Implements `GtkOrientable`.

## Static methods

Static methods are called on `Adw.WrapLayout`, imported from `@gtkx/gi/adw`.

### `new`

```ts
new(): Gtk.LayoutManager
```

Creates a new `AdwWrapLayout`.

**Returns** the newly created `AdwWrapLayout`

_Available since 1.7._

## Props

`ref` receives the `Adw.WrapLayout` instance. Every mutable property also has an `onNotify<Prop>` handler prop called with the new value when the property changes. Props inherited from ancestor elements are documented on their own pages.

### `align`

`number` · default `0.000000`

The alignment of the children within each line.

0 means the children are placed at the start of the line, 1 means they are
placed at the end of the line. 0.5 means they are placed in the middle of
the line.

Alignment is only used when `WrapLayout.justify` is set to
`Adw.JustifyMode.none`, or on the last line when the
`WrapLayout.justifyLastLine` is `FALSE`.

_Available since 1.7._

### `childSpacing`

`number` · default `0`

The spacing between widgets on the same line.

See `WrapLayout.childSpacingUnit`.

_Available since 1.7._

### `childSpacingUnit`

`Adw.LengthUnit` · default `ADW_LENGTH_UNIT_PX`

The length unit for child spacing.

Allows the spacing to vary depending on the text scale factor.

See `WrapLayout.childSpacing`.

_Available since 1.7._

### `justify`

`Adw.JustifyMode` · default `ADW_JUSTIFY_NONE`

Determines whether and how each complete line should be stretched to fill
the entire widget.

If set to `Adw.JustifyMode.fill`, each widget in the line will be
stretched, keeping consistent spacing, so that the line fills the entire
widget.

If set to `Adw.JustifyMode.spread`, the spacing between widgets will
be increased, keeping widget sizes intact. The first and last widget will
be aligned with the beginning and end of the line. If the line only
contains a single widget, it will be stretched regardless.

If set to `Adw.JustifyMode.none`, the line will not be stretched and
the children will be placed together within the line, according to
`WrapLayout.align`.

By default this doesn't affect the last line, as it will be incomplete. Use
`WrapLayout.justifyLastLine` to justify it as well.

_Available since 1.7._

### `justifyLastLine`

`boolean` · default `false`

Whether the last line should be stretched to fill the entire widget.

See `WrapLayout.justify`.

See `WrapLayout.lineSpacingUnit`.

_Available since 1.7._

### `lineSpacingUnit`

`Adw.LengthUnit` · default `ADW_LENGTH_UNIT_PX`

The length unit for line spacing.

Allows the spacing to vary depending on the text scale factor.

See `WrapLayout.lineSpacing`.

_Available since 1.7._

### `naturalLineLength`

`number` · default `-1`

Determines the natural size for each line.

It should be used to limit the line lengths, for example when used in
popovers.

See `WrapLayout.naturalLineLengthUnit`.

_Available since 1.7._

### `naturalLineLengthUnit`

`Adw.LengthUnit` · default `ADW_LENGTH_UNIT_PX`

The length unit for natural line length.

Allows the length to vary depending on the text scale factor.

See `WrapLayout.naturalLineLength`.

### `orientation`

`Gtk.Orientation` · default `GTK_ORIENTATION_HORIZONTAL` · from `GtkOrientable`

The orientation of the orientable.

### `packDirection`

`Adw.PackDirection` · default `ADW_PACK_START_TO_END`

The direction children are packed in each line.

_Available since 1.7._

### `wrapPolicy`

`Adw.WrapPolicy` · default `ADW_WRAP_NATURAL`

The policy for line wrapping.

If set to `Adw.WrapPolicy.natural`, the box will wrap to the next line
as soon as the previous line cannot fit any more children without shrinking
them past their natural size.

If set to `Adw.WrapPolicy.minimum`, the box will try to fit as many
children into each line as possible, shrinking them down to their minimum
size before wrapping to the next line.

_Available since 1.7._

### `wrapReverse`

`boolean` · default `false`

Whether wrap direction should be reversed.

By default, lines wrap downwards in a horizontal box, and towards the end
in a vertical box. If set to `TRUE`, they wrap upwards or towards the start
respectively.

_Available since 1.7._

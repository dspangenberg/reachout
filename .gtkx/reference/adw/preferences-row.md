# AdwPreferencesRow

A `Gtk.ListBoxRow` used to present preferences.

The `AdwPreferencesRow` widget has a title that `PreferencesDialog`
will use to let the user look for a preference. It doesn't present the title
in any way and lets you present the preference as you please.

`ActionRow` and its derivatives are convenient to use as preference
rows as they take care of presenting the preference's title while letting you
compose the inputs of the preference around it.

```tsx
import { AdwPreferencesRow } from "@gtkx/jsx/adw";
```

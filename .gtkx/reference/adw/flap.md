# AdwFlap

An adaptive container acting like a box or an overlay.

The `AdwFlap` widget can display its children like a `Gtk.Box` does or
like a `Gtk.Overlay` does, according to the
`Flap.foldPolicy` value.

`AdwFlap` has at most three children: `Flap.content`,
`Flap.flap` and `Flap.separator`. Content is the primary
child, flap is displayed next to it when unfolded, or overlays it when
folded. Flap can be shown or hidden by changing the
`Flap.revealFlap` value, as well as via swipe gestures if
`Flap.swipeToOpen` and/or `Flap.swipeToClose` are set
to `TRUE`.

Optionally, a separator can be provided, which would be displayed between
the content and the flap when there's no shadow to separate them, depending
on the transition type.

`Flap.flap` is transparent by default; add the
[`.background`](style-classes.html#background) style class to it if this is
unwanted.

If `Flap.modal` is set to `TRUE`, content becomes completely
inaccessible when the flap is revealed while folded.

The position of the flap and separator children relative to the content is
determined by orientation, as well as the `Flap.flapPosition`
value.

Folding the flap will automatically hide the flap widget, and unfolding it
will automatically reveal it. If this behavior is not desired, the
`Flap.locked` property can be used to override it.

Common use cases include sidebars, header bars that need to be able to
overlap the window content (for example, in fullscreen mode) and bottom
sheets.

### AdwFlap as GtkBuildable

The `AdwFlap` implementation of the `Gtk.Buildable` interface supports
setting the flap child by specifying “flap” as the “type” attribute of a
`<child>` element, and separator by specifying “separator”. Specifying
“content” child type or omitting it results in setting the content child.

### CSS nodes

`AdwFlap` has a single CSS node with name `flap`. The node will get the style
classes `.folded` when it is folded, and `.unfolded` when it's not.

## Static methods

Static methods are called on `Adw.Flap`, imported from `@gtkx/gi/adw`.

### `new`

```ts
new(): Gtk.Widget
```

Creates a new `AdwFlap`.

**Returns** the newly created `AdwFlap`

> **Deprecated since 1.4.** See [the migration guide](migrating-to-breakpoints.html#replace-adwflap)

## Props

`ref` receives the `Adw.Flap` instance. Every mutable property also has an `onNotify<Prop>` handler prop called with the new value when the property changes. Props inherited from ancestor elements are documented on their own pages.

### `content`

`Gtk.Widget | ReactElement` · deprecated since 1.4

The content widget.

It's always displayed when unfolded, and partially visible when folded.

> **Deprecated since 1.4.** See [the migration guide](migrating-to-breakpoints.html#replace-adwflap)

### `flap`

`Gtk.Widget | ReactElement` · deprecated since 1.4

The flap widget.

It's only visible when `Flap.revealProgress` is greater than 0.

> **Deprecated since 1.4.** See [the migration guide](migrating-to-breakpoints.html#replace-adwflap)

### `flapPosition`

`Gtk.PackType` · default `GTK_PACK_START` · deprecated since 1.4

The flap position.

If it's set to `Gtk.PackType.start`, the flap is displayed before the
content, if `Gtk.PackType.end`, it's displayed after the content.

> **Deprecated since 1.4.** See [the migration guide](migrating-to-breakpoints.html#replace-adwflap)

### `foldDuration`

`number` · default `250` · deprecated since 1.4

The fold transition animation duration, in milliseconds.

> **Deprecated since 1.4.** See [the migration guide](migrating-to-breakpoints.html#replace-adwflap)

### `folded`

`boolean` · default `false` · read-only, observe with `onNotifyFolded` · deprecated since 1.4

Whether the flap is currently folded.

See `Flap.foldPolicy`.

### `foldThresholdPolicy`

`Adw.FoldThresholdPolicy` · default `ADW_FOLD_THRESHOLD_POLICY_MINIMUM` · deprecated since 1.4

Determines when the flap will fold.

If set to `Adw.FoldThresholdPolicy.minimum`, flap will only fold when
the children cannot fit anymore. With `Adw.FoldThresholdPolicy.natural`,
it will fold as soon as children don't get their natural size.

This can be useful if you have a long ellipsizing label and want to let it
ellipsize instead of immediately folding.

> **Deprecated since 1.4.** See [the migration guide](migrating-to-breakpoints.html#replace-adwflap)

### `locked`

`boolean` · default `false` · deprecated since 1.4

If `FALSE`, folding when the flap is revealed automatically closes it, and
unfolding it when the flap is not revealed opens it. If `TRUE`,
`Flap.revealFlap` value never changes on its own.

> **Deprecated since 1.4.** See [the migration guide](migrating-to-breakpoints.html#replace-adwflap)

### `modal`

`boolean` · default `true` · deprecated since 1.4

# AdwAboutDialog

A dialog showing information about the application.

an about dialog is typically opened when the user activates the `About …`
item in the application's primary menu. All parts of the dialog are optional.

### Main page

`AdwAboutDialog` prominently displays the application's icon, name, developer
name and version. They can be set with the `AboutDialog.applicationIcon`,
`AboutDialog.applicationName`,
`AboutDialog.developerName` and `AboutDialog.version`
respectively.

### What's New

`AdwAboutDialog` provides a way for applications to display their release
notes, set with the `AboutDialog.releaseNotes` property.

Release notes are formatted the same way as
[AppStream descriptions](https://freedesktop.org/software/appstream/docs/chap-Metadata.html#tag-description).

The supported formatting options are:

* Paragraph (`<p>`)
* Ordered list (`<ol>`), with list items (`<li>`)
* Unordered list (`<ul>`), with list items (`<li>`)

Within paragraphs and list items, emphasis (`<em>`) and inline code
(`<code>`) text styles are supported. The emphasis is rendered in italic,
while inline code is shown in a monospaced font.

Any text outside paragraphs or list items is ignored.

Nested lists are not supported.

Only one version can be shown at a time. By default, the displayed version
number matches `AboutDialog.version`. Use
`AboutDialog.releaseNotesVersion` to override it.

### Details

The Details page displays the application comments and links.

The comments can be set with the `AboutDialog.comments` property.
Unlike `Gtk.AboutDialog.comments`, this string can be long and
detailed. It can also contain links and Pango markup.

To set the application website, use `AboutDialog.website`.
To add extra links below the website, use `AboutDialog.addLink()`.

If the Details page doesn't have any other content besides website, the
website will be displayed on the main page instead.

### Troubleshooting

`AdwAboutDialog` displays the following two links on the main page:

* Support Questions, set with the `AboutDialog.supportUrl` property,
* Report an Issue, set with the `AboutDialog.issueUrl` property.

Additionally, applications can provide debugging information. It will be
shown separately on the Troubleshooting page. Use the
`AboutDialog.debugInfo` property to specify it.

It's intended to be attached to issue reports when reporting issues against
the application. As such, it cannot contain markup or links.

`AdwAboutDialog` provides a quick way to save debug information to a file.
When saving, `AboutDialog.debugInfoFilename` would be used as
the suggested filename.

### Credits and Acknowledgements

The Credits page has the following default sections:

* Developers, set with the `AboutDialog.developers` property,
* Designers, set with the `AboutDialog.designers` property,
* Artists, set with the `AboutDialog.artists` property,
* Documenters, set with the `AboutDialog.documenters` property,
* Translators, set with the `AboutDialog.translatorCredits` property.

When setting translator credits, use the strings `"translator-credits"` or
`"translator_credits"` and mark them as translatable.

The default sections that don't contain any names won't be displayed.

The Credits page can also contain an arbitrary number of extra sections below
the default ones. Use `AboutDialog.addCreditSection()` to add them.

The Acknowledgements page can be used to acknowledge additional people and
organizations for their non-development contributions. Use
`AboutDialog.addAcknowledgementSection()` to add sections to it. For
example, it can be used to list backers in a crowdfunded project or to give
special thanks.

Each of the people or organizations can have an email address or a website
specified. To add a email address, use a string like
`Edgar Allan Poe <edgar@poe.com>`. To specify a website with a title, use a
string like `The GNOME Project https://www.gnome.org`:

### Legal

The Legal page displays the copyright and licensing information for the
application and other modules.

The copyright string is set with the `AboutDialog.copyright`
property and should be a short string of one or two lines, for example:
`© 2022 Example`.

Licensing information can be quickly set from a list of known licenses with
the `AboutDialog.licenseType` property. If the application's
license is not in the list, `AboutDialog.license` can be used
instead.

To add information about other modules, such as application dependencies or
data, use `AboutDialog.addLegalSection()`.

### Other applications

`AdwAboutDialog` can show links to your other apps at the end of the main
page. To add them, use `AboutDialog.addOtherApp()`.

### Constructing

To make constructing an `AdwAboutDialog` as convenient as possible, you can
use the function `showAboutDialog()` which constructs and shows a
dialog.

```c
static void
show_about (GtkApplication *app)
{
  const char *developers[] = {
    "Angela Avery",
    NULL
  };

  const char *designers[] = {
    "GNOME Design Team",
    NULL
  };

  adw_show_about_dialog (GTK_WIDGET (gtk_application_get_active_window (app)),
                         "application-name", _("Example"),
                         "application-icon", "org.example.App",

                         "copyright", "© 2022 Angela Avery",
                         "issue-url", "https://gitlab.gnome.org/example/example/-/issues/",
                         "license-type", GTK_LICENSE_GPL_3_0,
                         "developers", developers,
                         "designers", designers,
                         "translator-credits", _("translator-credits"),

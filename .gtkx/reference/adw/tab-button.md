# AdwTabButton

A button that displays the number of `TabView` pages.

`AdwTabButton` is a button that displays the number of pages in a given
`AdwTabView`, as well as whether one of the inactive pages needs attention.

It's intended to be used as a visible indicator when there's no visible tab
bar, typically opening an `TabOverview` on click, e.g. via the
`overview.open` action name:

```xml
<object class="AdwTabButton">
  <property name="view">view</property>
  <property name="action-name">overview.open</property>
</object>
```
